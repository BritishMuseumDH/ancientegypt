After many more days, the boy saw a patch of green in the distance. He hoped that this was the oasis where the pharaoh's vineyard was. He would be able to find water and shade. 
</p><p>
When he reached the oasis, he filled his water pouch and splashed his face with water. He asked the local people if they had seen his brother or a group of workers. But he could not find anyone who had see them. 
</p><p>
He rested for a day, then thought about where he should go next. He had still not found any trace of his brother.
</p>
<p><b>
Should he join a passing caravan, or go back through the desert to the Faiyum?
