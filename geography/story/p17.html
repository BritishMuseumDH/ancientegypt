After many days of walking, the boy spotted green trees and a lake in the distance. The homes at the edge of the fields looked like small brown boxes. 
</p><p>
The boy was tired, dusty, hungry and thirsty after his trip. He walked past the homes and through the freshly planted fields. Finally, he reached the lake. 
</p><p>
He sat down on the shore and took a deep breath. He thought back on his adventure and all that he had seen. In a couple of days, he would be able to catch a boat which would take him home. Maybe he would find his brother on his way home. He lay back and went to sleep.
