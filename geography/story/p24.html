The boy walked for many days through the marshy land. Finally, he reached the coast. 
</p><p>
The water was clear and blue and it shimmered in the sun. He could see a large ship in the distance sailing towards Egypt. He wondered what riches it was carrying. 
</p><p>
He went to the nearest town and asked if he could join the crew. 
</p><p>
The next day, as the men arrived at the boat, he saw a familiar face in the crowds. It was his brother. He waved his arms and shouted. His brother turned around and smiled. The brothers ran towards each other and hugged. Then, they climbed the ramp up to the boat. It was the beginning of a new adventure for both of them.
