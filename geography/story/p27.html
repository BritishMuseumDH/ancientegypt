After many days, the boy noticed caravan tracks. He followed these tracks for several days until he reached a hill. 
</p><p>
The tracks stopped at the opening of the mine. The boy said a quick prayer to Hathor, the goddess of the turquoise mines. Then he entered the mine. 
</p><p>
The workers had already left, and the silence of the place scared him. All of a sudden, he heard a noise behind him. He bent down,  picked up a handful of turquoise chips from the ground, and hid behind a large boulder. A guard walked by, and the boy held his breath for a minute. 
</p><p>
After about an hour, the boy crept out of his hiding place. He had not found his brother, and he was now in danger.

Should he go back towards the Nile, or head for the coast?
