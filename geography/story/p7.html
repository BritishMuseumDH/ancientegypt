After days and days of walking, the boy reached the sandstone quarry. This quarry provided the blocks of stone that were used to build temples. It was usually full of workers, but today it was empty. 
</p><p>
The boy looked at the large holes left in the quarry walls where the blocks had been removed. All that was left were the marks of the quarrymen's tools. 
</p><p>
After looking around in the quarry, the boy climbed to the rim again. He stood and looked out over the desert. He watched the sun set in the west, and lay down to rest. Perhaps he would find his brother when he returned to the Nile.
