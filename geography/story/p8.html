After many days of walking, the boy was still surrounded by desert.The only sounds he heard were those of his feet hitting the ground, and the occasional cries of a bird overhead. 
</p><p>
The only people who lived in the desert were the bedu. They were small groups of  people who moved around from place to place. They did not farm the land, so they did not need the rich soil on the banks of the Nile. 
</p><p>
He sat down on a rock to rest, and think. If he continued on, he would reach the quarry. If he turned back towards the Nile, he could catch a boat going downstream. 
</p>
<p><b>
Should he go towards the quarry, or go back into the desert towards the Nile?
