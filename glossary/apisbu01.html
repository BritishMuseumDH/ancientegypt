<p>
A sacred animal to the ancient Egyptians whose cult was centred around Memphis in Lower Egypt. 
<p> It was very rare for a black bull to be born with white markings, so when one was, the Egyptians saw it as a sacred sign and worshipped the animal.  One bull at a time with the white markings was named the 'Apis Bull'.
<p> The Apis Bull was honoured in ceremonies and then mummified and buried in a tomb when it died. The mother of the Apis Bull was called the 'Isis Cow' and was also worshipped.
