Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C..  In 323 B.C., Alexander died and his empire was split up among his generals.  
<p>The general who became the ruler of Egypt was named Ptolemy.  Thus, the period that his successors ruled for (until about 30 B.C.) is called the Ptolemaic Period.  Since Ptolemy was from Greece, there was a lot of Greek influence on Egyptian art, culture and religion during this period.  The famous queen, Cleopatra VII, was the last ruler of the Ptolemaic period.
