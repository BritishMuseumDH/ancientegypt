When Jane opened her eyes, the room was dark.  She realised that she must have been asleep for hours.

She tried to find her way out of the museum but all of the doors were locked.

She realised that she was locked in the museum- all alone in the dark...
</p>
<p>
To get Jane out of the museum you must ask the gods and goddesses for help. They may ask you to bring them something before they give you any advice. Wake up Hathor first and remember Jane is counting on you...
