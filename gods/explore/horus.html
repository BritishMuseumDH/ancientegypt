The ancient Egyptians had many different beliefs about the god Horus.  One of the most common beliefs was that Horus was the son of Isis and Osiris.
<p>After Osiris was murdered by his brother Seth, Horus fought with Seth for the throne of Egypt.  
<p>
In this battle, Horus lost one of his eyes. The eye was restored to him and it became a symbol of protection for the ancient Egyptians.  After this battle, Horus was chosen to be the ruler of the world of the living.
