<b>Moving the Beit el-Wali Temple</b>
<p>
In the 1960's, the Aswan High Dam was built, creating a reservoir known as Lake Nasser, which flooded much of what was once ancient Nubia.  While the dam was being built, many temples that were located along the Nile in towns like Beit el-Wali were moved to higher ground so that they would not be flooded.  One of the temples that was moved was the Beit el-Wali temple.
<p>
Moving even a small temple is difficult, since it has to be taken apart block by block, then reassembled in another location.  The Beit el-Wali temple was even more tricky to move because it was actually carved into a large outcrop of rock.  However, it was successfully moved to a location about 40 miles north of the original site. Today, the original site is under the water of Lake Nasser.
