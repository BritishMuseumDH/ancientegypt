<b>Battle in Nubia&nbsp;</b>
<p>No one knows when the battle that is shown on the Beit el-Wali wall actually happened. In fact, it may have occurred when Ramesses II was only the crown prince of Egypt. It is thought that when he was the pharaoh, he had the temple at Beit el-Wali built, and had himself shown as the pharaoh in the battle and tribute scenes.
<p>
Although this may not have been historically correct, it was not considered to be dishonest to the ancient Egyptian mind. Remember that Ramesses II had the scene carved on the wall to show the gods that he was doing a good job protecting Egypt from foreign armies, not to make a historical record of the actual date of the event.
