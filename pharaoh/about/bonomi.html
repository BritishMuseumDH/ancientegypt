<b>Bonomi the Traveller</b>
<p>
In the early 1800's there were many people from countries in the west (like England and France) who were interested in the ancient ruins in Egypt and the <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/levant01.html','levant12')">Levant</a>.  Some of these travellers were simply tourists, and some were hired to record what they saw, through writing or drawing.  One such traveller, a man named Joseph Bonomi, travelled all around Egypt and Nubia sketching ancient monuments and tombs.
<p>
When Bonomi visited the temple at Beit el-Wali, he was impressed by the wall reliefs there.  He made notes of the colours and carvings on some of  the temple walls, then made plaster <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/mould01.html','mould02')">moulds</a> of particular scenes so that he could take them back to England and make casts of them.  Unfortunately, when Bonomi removed the plaster moulds from the wall, all traces of the original paint were removed from the wall as well.  The cast that you now see was made from Bonomi's plaster mould.  It was then painted based on Bonomi's observation of the colours that were there when he first saw it.
