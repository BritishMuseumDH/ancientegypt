<b>The Temple at Beit el-Wali</b>
<p>
The Beit el-Wali temple is located in the area south of Egypt known to the Egyptians as Wawat, and to us as ancient  'Nubia'.  Built by Ramesses II early in his <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/reign01.html','reign03')">reign</a>, the temple was supposed to remind the local people of the power of the Egyptian pharaoh, and to promote the worship of Egyptian gods.
<p>
The temple is small, and follows a simple plan- unlike some of the grand New Kingdom temples.  There is a courtyard, decorated with scenes showing the pharaoh Ramesses II in battle against the enemies of Egypt.  The northern wall of this courtyard has reliefs showing a battle between the Egyptians and their enemies to the northeast, the <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/asiati01.html','asiati01')">Asiatics</a>.  The southern wall of the courtyard has reliefs showing a battle between the Egyptians and their enemies to the south, the Nubians.
<p>
Beyond the courtyard, there is a chamber carved out of a rock, against which the temple sits.  This inner chamber was where all of the important priestly activity took place, and where the statue of a god would have been.
