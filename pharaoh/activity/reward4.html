Throw stick</font>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=+0>
<P>
<b>Conservator</b><br>
This object is made of glazed composition.  It is in good shape and the glaze is still quite shiny.  It is a fine example of the blue glaze that was often used in ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
<b>Curator</b><br>
This throw stick is a symbolic object that would have been carried in a festival.  It looks like the throw sticks that were used in hunting.  
</P>
<P>
<b>Archaeologist</b><br>
This object was found in the third layer of sand in Area D. The long straight shape could be seen even before they cleared the sand away.

Uraeus</font>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=+0>
<p>
<b>Conservator</b><br>
This object is made of bronze and is decorated with enamel.  The bronze is now a green colour.  The red and blue enamel has lasted well. There are only a couple of patches missing, and some surface scratches.
</P>
<P>
<b>Curator</b><br>
This object represents two cobras ready to strike.  They represent the cobra goddess of Lower Egypt, Wadjyt. 
</P>

<b>Archaeologist</b><br>
"I could not believe my eyes when I looked down into the digging pit and saw a hint of bronze, turned green with age, sticking out of the sand.  We gently dug around it and finally got it out..."

Gold flies</font>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=+0>
<p>
<b>Conservator</b> <br>
This object is one of a pair. It was meant to hang on a chain, and still has small loops on top.  It is made of gold and is carved to look like an insect.
</P>
<P>
<b>Curator</b><br>
This object would have been given as an award for good military service to the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians believed that people who kept on fighting - even when they were pushed away - were good soldiers. This object looks like an insect that keeps coming back even when it is swatted away.
</P>
<P>
<b>Archaeologist</b> 	<br>
"...one day as I sifted through some sand from the tomb, I found a pair of tiny gold flies.  They must have been dropped by a tomb robber thousands of years ago and had been lying on the floor of the tomb ever since."

Gold plaque</font>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=+0>
<p>
<b>Conservator</b><br>
This object was probably carved from a thin sheet of gold.  It is very delicate, and I think that it should be mounted on a block of wood covered with black velvet so that it does not break.
</P>
<P>
<b>Curator</b><br>
This plaque shows a scene with the pharaoh and the god Atum.  The pharaoh, with his cartouche above his head holds out a pot towards Atum.  Atum holds the ankh in one hand and the was-sceptre in the other.
</P>
<P>
<b>Archaeologist</b><br>
The small, gold plaque was found in the seventh layer of the site.  It was quite delicate, and had to be carried out on a tray.
