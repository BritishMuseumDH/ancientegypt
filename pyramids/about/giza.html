In the fourth dynasty, three large stone pyramids were built at Giza. The design of these pyramids was based on the pyramids that had been built before. These are the largest and sturdiest pyramids that were ever built in ancient Egypt.
<p>
The first and largest pyramid was built for the pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops).
<p>
The second largest pyramid was built for Khufu's son, Khafra (also known as Chephren). In addition to the usual parts of a pyramid complex, Khafra's pyramid is guarded by a huge <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/sphinx01.html','sphinx03')">sphinx</a>.

<p>
Finally, the third largest pyramid was built for the pharaoh Menkaure (also known as Mycerinus).
<p>
The ancient Egyptians continued to build pyramids for their pharaohs after the Giza pyramids were built.  However they were never as big or well-designed as the Giza pyramids.
