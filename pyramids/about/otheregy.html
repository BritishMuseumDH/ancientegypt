<p>
The ancient Egyptians believed that it was important to be buried properly.  A proper burial would allow them to live again in the <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/afterl01.html','afterl09')">afterlife</a>. Thus, most people who could afford to, spent a lot of time and effort making sure that they would be buried well.  
<p>
Most ordinary ancient Egyptians were probably buried in the desert.  Their relatives would wrap their body in a simple cloth and bury it with some everyday objects and food. 
<p>
Those with more wealth would be able to afford a better burial. The graves of some craftsmen and workers have been found containing a <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/mummif01.html','mummif08')">mummified</a> body as well as bread, fruit, amulets and furniture for the afterlife. 
<p>
Nobles and very wealthy people were often buried in tombs that we call <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/mastab01.html','mastab03')">'mastabas'</a>. This kind of tomb has an underground burial chamber and an above ground <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/offeri01.html','offeri05')">offering</a> chapel. These tombs would contain the person's mummified body, as well as food, jewellery and special objects.
