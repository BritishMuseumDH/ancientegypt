A list of complicated words, Egyptological terms and historical terms that are used and defined in the site.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><font size=+0><a href="#home">Home Page</a>&nbsp;<a href="#story">Story</a>&nbsp;<a href="#explore">Explore</a>&nbsp;</font>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>Innundation<br>
<font size="-1">The yearly flooding of the Nile River.</font></p>

<p>Irrigation<br>

<a NAME="explore">
<img src="../images/explore.gif" width=58 height=18 border=0>
<p>Archaeological<br>
<font size="-1">Something which relates to archaeology. Archaeology is the study of past cultures based on artifacts, texts and monuments left behind by that culture.</font></p>

<p>Aswan High Dam<br>
<font size="-1">A dam built in the 1960s to control the annual flooding of the Nile, and to create a reservoir.  The water flowing from the Nile sources collects south of the dam forming Lake Nasser which covers over with water much of the area that was ancient Nubia.</font></p>

<p>Contours<br>
<font size="-1">The outline of a natural feature of the landscape such as a mountain or a coastline.</font></p>

<p>Lake Nasser<br>
<font size="-1">The reservoir that was formed after the Nile was blocked by the Aswan High Dam.  Lake Nasser covers much of the area that was ancient Nubia.</font></p>

<p>Natural Resources<br>
<font size="-1">Something that is easily available to the people who live in an area, rather than something that needs to be brought into the area from another place.  For instance, tall trees were not one of Egypt's natural resources, so they needed to import trees from a country where there were many forests, like Phoenicia (modern-day Lebanon).</font></p>

<p>Suez Canal<br>
<font size="-1">A canal that joins the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.Building the canal made it easier to transport goods from the east to the Mediterranean; thus creating an important trade route.The canal was started in 1859, and was completed in 1869. It was originally 200 feet (60.1 metres) wide, and 24 feet (7.3 metres) deep. The canal has been made wider and deeper over the years, and now it is 500 feet (152.4 metres) wide and about 33 feet (10.1 metres) deep.</font></p>
