<!--- --------------STORY ---------------- --->
The story presents a tale of an ancient Egyptian boy who sets out from his family home in search of the brother he has not seen for two years. On his journey he travels across the varied landscape of ancient Egypt. In this story, pupils are given choices about where the boy goes on his journey, thus involving them in the ‘writing' of the story. This section could be used to introduce pupils to the landscape of ancient Egypt, transportation and natural resources.

This section could be used to introduce pupils to the landscape of ancient Egypt, and how modern changes such as the Suez Canal and the Aswan High Dam have effected the landscape and way of life on the Nile today.
