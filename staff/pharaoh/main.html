The story presents a narrative based on a wall relief from an ancient Egyptian temple. This section can be used to introduce, illustrate or emphasize the fact that there are ‘stories' being told in the wall reliefs of ancient Egypt. In addition, it can be used to discuss kingship, conquest, tribute, trade and ideas of interpretation both in terms of how something is presented and how it is understood.

This section could be used to discuss ideas of kingship, conquest, tribute, trade and interpretation.  This section could also be used to discuss conventions in ancient Egyptian wall painting.

<!--- ---------- CHALLENGE ----------------- --->
‘Ask the experts' presents the user with four different objects that have become separated from cards that describe their physical appearance, archaeological context and historical context. Pupils use visual and textual clues to correctly match cards with objects. This activity can be used to encourage pupils to think about how people from different fields (with different specialties/perspectives) can view the same object.  It can be used to introduce ideas of interpretation.
