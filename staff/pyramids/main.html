'How big is the Great Pyramid?' is an activity designed to convey the relative size of this structure, by comparing its height, weight and area to that of a double decker bus.  Pupils are asked to estimate the height, weight and area of the Great Pyramid in terms of a double decker bus, after which they are presented with a relevant mathematical problem to solve.
