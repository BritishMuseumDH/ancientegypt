<p>
Begin by discussing the importance of writing as a means for record keeping and communication. Why is writing important? How is writing used?
</p><p>
Introduce and define the word script. Explain how a script is different from a language. Give an example of how the same script can be used to record different languages, such as how the Roman script is used to record English, French, Spanish, etc.. Ask pupils to think of other scripts used around the world. Discuss how scripts are different. What is a script? What is the difference between a script and a language? What other kinds of scripts can you think of that are used around the world today?
</p><p>
Explain that the ancient Egyptians actually used different scripts to record different types of information. For example, hieroglyphic script was used throughout ancient Egyptian history to record information about the pharaoh and religion, whereas, at different times, the hieratic and demotic scripts were used for record-keeping, every day transactions, and literary works. Why might it be important, necessary or meaningful to use different scripts for recording different types of information? 
</p><p>
Explain how scripts are different, giving examples of scripts from around the world. 
</p><p>
Show pupils photographs of temples or objects with hieroglyphic script on them. Ask pupils to describe what the script looks like.
</p><p>
Introduce the structure of the hieroglyphic script, emphasizing that it is not picture writing. Give examples of the different types of hieroglyphs.
</p><p>
Wrap up the discussion by showing pupils photographs of hieroglyphic inscriptions from temples. You could also give a brief explanation of how ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic script was deciphered.

<p>
A script is the character set used to record a spoken language as part of a writing system. Writing systems can be made up of many different types of characters. The system of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs is a complex one because some hieroglyphic signs are phonograms and some are pictographs.  Thus, there are signs representing both sounds and things.
</p><p>
The word ‘hieroglyph' comes from the Greek, meaning ‘sacred word'. The hieroglyphic script was developed as a complete writing system in about 3200 B.C.. According to ancient Egyptian myths, writing was the gift of Thoth, the god of writing and knowledge. As hieroglyphic script was the sacred script in ancient Egypt, it was only used to record important information about the pharaoh and religion. Reflecting their sacred nature, hieroglyphs cover temple and tomb walls. Hieroglyphs are also written on special objects, stelai and some papyrus scrolls.
</p><p>
A basic explanation of the different types of hieroglyphic signs is as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Some hieroglyphs are phonograms; they can stand for a sound in a word. For example, the sign XXX stands for the single sound 'f'.
<li>
Some hieroglyphs can stand for more than one sound. For example, the hieroglyph XXX stands  for the sound 'mn'. 
<li>
Some hieroglyphs help you work out what the words mean. They are sometimes called >sense signs= or >determinatives= because they help you make sense of the words that come before them. These signs were important because there were no vowels in the hieroglyphic script. 
 For instance, the signs XXX, XXX, XXX together could mean either= boat= or >taste=.  By adding the determinative XXX to the end of XXX, XXX, XXX, the word means >boat=. Yet with the determinative XXX (an ox tongue) at the end of the word, it means >taste=.  To learn more about these signs, try the challenge.
<li>
Finally, some hieroglyphs are pictographs; they stand for the thing that they look like.  For example, the sign XXX means the sun.
</ul>



<p>
Hieroglyphs can be read from left to right, or right to left.  Often they are read top to bottom. You can work out where to start reading by looking at the direction that the hieroglyphs (the animals' heads, people and objects) are facing. 
</p><p>
Hieroglyphs were deciphered in the beginning of the 19th century. There is information about the Rosetta Stone and decipherment of hieroglyphs on the bottom of the Writing Home Page.
