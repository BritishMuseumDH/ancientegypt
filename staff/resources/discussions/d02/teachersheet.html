<p>
Begin a discussion by asking pupils to identify some of the basic necessities of life (i.e.: what they require from their environment on a fundamental level to ensure survival), such as food, water and shelter. Then discuss how the natural resources and landscape of a place can affect whether or not people settle there. Can people grow food there? Is there an adequate and sustainable water source? 
</p><p>
Show pupils a map of ancient Egypt and ask them to describe the land. Is there a source of water? How much fertile land is there? How is it distributed? 
</p><p>
Ask pupils to comment on how the nature of this landscape might affect the way that people settle and ultimately use the land. Where would they settle, and why? 
</p><p>
Explain some of the ways that the landscape and climate in ancient Egypt was unique, and how people used the land. You could make a link with modern Egypt by discussing major recent changes made by humans to the environment (Suez Canal and Aswan High Dam), and how they have affected the way people use the land in Egypt today.
</p><p>
Wrap-up the discussion by emphasising the impact of the land on the way the ancient Egyptians lived. It is also important to point out the role the climate has played in preserving materials and objects from ancient Egypt.

<p>
The geography and climate of ancient Egypt are unique. Egypt is situated in the northeast corner of the African continent, bordering on the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the land of ancient Egypt was barren desert. However, a narrow strip of fertile land on the banks of the Nile river made it possible for life to be sustained on the land there. This is why the Greek writer Herodotus called Egypt the ‘gift of the river'.
</p><p>
The yearly flooding and receding of the Nile determined how people lived in ancient Egypt. The land on the banks of the river was devoted to fields where crops were grown. During the flood season, this land was under water. When the flood waters receded, a layer of rich, mineral enriched black silt was left on these fields, leaving them ready to support another crop. This is why the ancient Egyptians did not need to add fertilizer to their land, as they do today. 
</p><p>
The bulk of the population lived on the edge of the fertile land and the desert for two reasons. The first reason was so their homes would not be left under water during the flood.  People lived in homes made from mudbricks (a mixture of mud and reeds that was moulded into bricks and left to harden in the sun). Since it hardly ever rained in ancient Egypt, the danger of disintegration of the mudbrick during a rainstorm was minimal. However, if a house of mudbricks was covered with water for weeks it would not survive. The second reason for living on the edge of the desert was so the maximum amount of fertile land could be used for planting crops.
</p><p>
Since the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960's, the interaction between people and the land in Egypt has changed dramatically. The Dam has ceased the yearly flooding of the Nile river downstream of Aswan. This has meant that the fields are no longer replenished by the silt from the flood. Farmers now need to use fertilizers to enrich the soil so it can be used for growing.
