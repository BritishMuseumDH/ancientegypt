}{\plain \b\fs28 Discussion}{\plain \fs28 :\par
}{\plain \fs28 Discuss what wall reliefs are and say where they are found in ancient Egypt.}{\plain \fs28  
}{\plain \i\fs28 Where do you find wall reliefs?}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Inform pupils that the example they will be looking at is from the Beit el-Wali 
temple from Nubia. Show the children where Nubia was on the map and discuss 
the fact that the Beit el-Wali temple was built there by an ancient Egyptian 
pharaoh. }{\plain \i\fs28 Why do you think the Beit el-Wali temple was built in Nubia? What was 
the relationship between the ancient Egyptians and the Nubians during the time 
when this temple was built (the New Kingdom)?}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Explain to the children what the shape and layout of the temple was like}{\plain \fs28 , and 
where the wall reliefs which they are going to look at came from. Explain that the 
object they will see on the web site is actually a cast of the wall reliefs of the 
temple. Show pupils the line drawings of the Beit el-Wali relief and ask them to 
share what they see.}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Discuss what the purpose of wall reliefs was, and what type of scenes appear in 
wall reliefs.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Wrap-up the discussion by explaining to the children why the temple was moved 
from its original location, and roughly where it is today.}{\plain \fs28 \par

}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \b\fs28 Background information:}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The walls of ancient Egyptian temples were decorated with carved and painted 
wall reliefs.  These reliefs showed ceremonies and rituals that the ancient 
Egyptians believed were necessary to maintain order in the world.  They also 
showed battles and tribute scenes which were an important part of maintaining 
power and balance in the world as well. }{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The Beit el-Wali temple was built in Nubia by the pharaoh Ramesses II during a 
period of the New Kingdom (1550 B.C. to 1069 B.C.) when the ancient Egyptians 
controlled the area.}{\plain \fs28  }{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \b\fs28 The Temple at Beit el-Wali}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The Beit el-Wali temple is located in the area south of Egypt known to the 
Egyptians as Wawat, and to us as ancient  \'27Nubia\'92.  Built by Ramesses II early in 
his reign, the temple was supposed to remind the local people of the power of the 
Egyptian pharaoh, and to promote the worship of Egyptian gods.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The temple is small, and follows a simple plan- unlike some of the grand New 
Kingdom temples.  There is a courtyard, decorated with scenes showing the 
pharaoh Ramesses II in battle against the enemies of Egypt.  The northern wall of 
this courtyard has reliefs showing a battle between the Egyptians and their 
enemies to the northeast, the Asiatics.  The southern wall of the courtyard has 
reliefs showing a battle between the Egyptians and their enemies to the south, the 
Nubians.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Beyond the courtyard, there is a chamber carved out of a rock, against which the 
temple sits.  This inner chamber was where all the important priestly activity took 
place, and where the statue of a god would have been.  \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 }{\plain \fs28 In the 1960\'92s, the Aswan High Dam was built, creating a reservoir known as Lake 
Nasser, which flooded much of what was once ancient Nubia.  While the dam was 
being built, many temples that were located along the Nile in towns like Beit el-Wali were moved to higher ground so that they would not be flooded.  One of the 
temples that was moved was the Beit el-Wali temple.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Moving even a small temple is difficult, since it has to be taken apart block by 
block, then reassembled in another location.  The Beit el-Wali temple was even 
more tricky to move because it was actually carved into a large outcrop of rock.  
However, it was successfully moved to a location about 40 miles north of the 
original site. Today, the original site is under the water of Lake Nasser. }{\plain \b\ul\fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \b\fs28 Battle in Nubia}{\plain \b\ul\fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 No one knows when the battle that is shown on the Beit el-Wali wall actually 
happened.  In fact, it may have occurred when Ramesses II was only the crown 
prince of Egypt.  It is thought that when he was the pharaoh, he had the temple at 
Beit el-Wali built, and had himself shown as the pharaoh in the battle and tribute 
scenes.  \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Although this may not have been historically correct, it was not considered to be 
dishonest to the ancient Egyptian mind.  Remember that Ramesses II had the scene 
carved on the wall to show the gods that he was doing a good job protecting Egypt 
from foreign armies, not to make a historical record of the actual date of the event.\par
}{\plain \b\ul\fs28 \par
}{\plain \b\fs28 Who made the cast?}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 In the early 1800\'92s there were many people from countries in the west (like 
England and France) who were interested in the ancient ruins in Egypt and the 
Levant.  Some of these travellers were simply tourists, and some were hired to 
record what they saw, through writing or drawing.  One such traveller, a man 
named Joseph Bonomi, travelled all around Egypt and Nubia sketching ancient 
monuments and tombs. \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Joseph Bonomi made moulds of many of the ancient sculptures and wall reliefs 
that he saw on his journeys through Egypt and Nubia.  When he returned to 
England, he made plaster casts from these moulds.  When Bonomi died, he left his 
collection of casts to the British Museum.}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \b\fs28 Where is the cast?}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The plaster cast of the wall reliefs from the Beit el-Wali temple is on display in the 
\'27Egypt and Africa\'92 room (Room 65) of the British Museum in London.   \par
