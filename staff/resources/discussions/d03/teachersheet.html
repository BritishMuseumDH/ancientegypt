<p>
Discuss what wall reliefs are and say where they are found in ancient Egypt. Where do you find wall reliefs?
</p><p>
Inform pupils that the example they will be looking at is from the Beit el-Wali temple from Nubia. Show the children where Nubia was on the map and discuss the fact that the Beit el-Wali temple was built there by an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. Why do you think the Beit el-Wali temple was built in Nubia? What was the relationship between the ancient Egyptians and the Nubians during the time when this temple was built (the New Kingdom)?
</p><p>
Explain to the children what the shape and layout of the temple was like, and where the wall reliefs which they are going to look at came from. Explain that the object they will see on the web site is actually a cast of the wall reliefs of the temple. Show pupils the line drawings of the Beit el-Wali relief and ask them to share what they see.
</p><p>
Discuss what the purpose of wall reliefs was, and what type of scenes appear in wall reliefs.
</p><p>
Wrap-up the discussion by explaining to the children why the temple was moved from its original location, and roughly where it is today.
</p>

<p>
The walls of ancient Egyptian temples were decorated with carved and painted wall reliefs.  These reliefs showed ceremonies and rituals that the ancient Egyptians believed were necessary to maintain order in the world.  They also showed battles and tribute scenes which were an important part of maintaining power and balance in the world as well. 
</p><p>
The Beit el-Wali temple was built in Nubia by the pharaoh Ramesses II during a period of the New Kingdom (1550 B.C. to 1069 B.C.) when the ancient Egyptians controlled the area. 
</p><p>
<b>The Temple at Beit el-Wali</b><br>
The Beit el-Wali temple is located in the area south of Egypt known to the Egyptians as Wawat, and to us as ancient  'Nubia'.  Built by Ramesses II early in his reign, the temple was supposed to remind the local people of the power of the Egyptian pharaoh, and to promote the worship of Egyptian gods.
</p><p>
The temple is small, and follows a simple plan- unlike some of the grand New Kingdom temples.  There is a courtyard, decorated with scenes showing the pharaoh Ramesses II in battle against the enemies of Egypt.  The northern wall of this courtyard has reliefs showing a battle between the Egyptians and their enemies to the northeast, the Asiatics.  The southern wall of the courtyard has reliefs showing a battle between the Egyptians and their enemies to the south, the Nubians.
</p><p>
Beyond the courtyard, there is a chamber carved out of a rock, against which the temple sits.  This inner chamber was where all the important priestly activity took place, and where the statue of a god would have been.  
</p><p>
In the 1960's, the Aswan High Dam was built, creating a reservoir known as Lake Nasser, which flooded much of what was once ancient Nubia.  While the dam was being built, many temples that were located along the Nile in towns like Beit el-Wali were moved to higher ground so that they would not be flooded.  One of the temples that was moved was the Beit el-Wali temple.
</p><p>
Moving even a small temple is difficult, since it has to be taken apart block by block, then reassembled in another location.  The Beit el-Wali temple was even more tricky to move because it was actually carved into a large outcrop of rock.  However, it was successfully moved to a location about 40 miles north of the original site. Today, the original site is under the water of Lake Nasser. 
</p><p>
<b>Battle in Nubia</b><br>
No one knows when the battle that is shown on the Beit el-Wali wall actually happened.  In fact, it may have occurred when Ramesses II was only the crown prince of Egypt.  It is thought that when he was the pharaoh, he had the temple at Beit el-Wali built, and had himself shown as the pharaoh in the battle and tribute scenes.  
</p><p>
Although this may not have been historically correct, it was not considered to be dishonest to the ancient Egyptian mind.  Remember that Ramesses II had the scene carved on the wall to show the gods that he was doing a good job protecting Egypt from foreign armies, not to make a historical record of the actual date of the event.
</p><p>
<b>Who made the cast?</b><br>
In the early 1800's there were many people from countries in the west (like England and France) who were interested in the ancient ruins in Egypt and the Levant.  Some of these travellers were simply tourists, and some were hired to record what they saw, through writing or drawing.  One such traveller, a man named Joseph Bonomi, travelled all around Egypt and Nubia sketching ancient monuments and tombs. 
</p><p>
Joseph Bonomi made moulds of many of the ancient sculptures and wall reliefs that he saw on his journeys through Egypt and Nubia.  When he returned to England, he made plaster casts from these moulds.  When Bonomi died, he left his collection of casts to the British Museum.
</p><p>
<b>Where is the cast?</b><br>
The plaster cast of the wall reliefs from the Beit el-Wali temple is on display in the 'Egypt and Africa' room (Room 65) of the British Museum in London.
