}{\plain \b\fs28 Discussion:}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Introduce the topic by discussing what makes a society and how societies are 
structured. }{\plain \i\fs28 What is a society? What makes a society? How are the levels of 
society determined or defined?}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Ask pupils to think about different types of people or professions they know 
existed in ancient Egypt, and list them on the board. Show photographs of 
objects, wall paintings and images of people from ancient Egypt if possible and 
ask pupils to classify them based on their actions, clothing and context. See if it 
is possible to group them together and order them according to who was the 
most and least privileged. \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Ask them to consider which group would have the largest number of people, 
and which would have the least.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Compare the class list with the list provided in the background information. 
}{\plain \i\fs28 How are the two lists similar? How are the two lists different? }{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Discuss the types of evidence that might be used to construct a list like this.}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Wrap-up the discussion by reinforcing the fact that social structures are usually 
not so well defined and exact, but that defining a social structure helps us 
understand some important things about how the civilization worked.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \b\fs28 Background Information:\par
}{\plain \fs28 A society is a group of people who live in a community and are dependent 
upon each other for food, shelter, wealth and land. Societies can be structured 
in many different ways and some are more flexible than others. Ancient 
Egyptian social structure was pretty well-defined and rigid. People did not 
readily move from one level of society to another. This is not to say that it 
never happened, however, it was not common. There were certain situations 
where a person from one level of society could move from one to the other, but 
it usually occurred in the upper levels of society.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 This breakdown of the levels of society has been constructed by historians 
based on objects and texts from ancient Egypt. Thus, the definitions have been 
made by modern scholars. The ancient Egyptians would not necessarily have 
seen their social structure in the same way, just as perceptions of modern 
societies differ whether they are internal or external.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Society in ancient Egypt was made up of many different levels. At each level 
there were people with similar jobs and economic positions. Where people 
lived, what they ate, what they wore and what they owned depended on what 
social class they were a part of.\tab \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 This is a general breakdown of the different levels of society:\par
}{\plain \fs28 The highest level of society was the royal family. The royal family included the 
pharaoh, his wives and his children. They lived in palaces, ate the finest food, 
and wore the finest clothing and jewellery.  This was the most privileged sector 
of the population, and represented a tiny percentage of ancient Egyptian 
society.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Those at the next level of society were the noblemen who surrounded the 
pharaoh.}{\plain \fs28   They lived well in large homes with plenty of food to eat. They also 
controlled large estates. These people represented a small  percent of the 
population.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28  The next level of society was made up of scribes. Scribes became officials in 
the government or temple priests. Successful scribes were promoted to being 
high officials in the pharaoh\'92s court or high priests.}{\plain \fs28  Scribes represented a small 
percentage of the population.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The next level of society was made up of craftsmen and artisans.  Craftsmen 
and artisans were often well-to-do by ancient Egyptian standards.  The children 
of craftsmen or artisans could even attend school to become a scribe if their 
parents were well-connected.  Craftsmen and artisans made up a relatively 
small percent of the population. \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The next level of society was made up of  household servants who worked in 
the homes of wealthy noblemen. They represented a small percent of the 
population.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The next level of society was made up of farmers.  Farmers usually worked on 
land that belonged to the pharaoh or the temple.  They had to give a percentage 
of their harvest as a tax either to the pharaoh or the temple.  They lived in small 
homes, and traded their crops for other kinds of food.  Farmers made up the 
bulk of the population.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The lowest level of society was made up of slaves and  foreign captives.  They 
were usually forced to work on building projects or in the mines for the 
government or the pharaoh.  They made up a relatively small percentage of the 
population.\par
