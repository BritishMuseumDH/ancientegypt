<p>
Introduce the topic by discussing what makes a society and how societies are structured. What is a society? What makes a society? How are the levels of society determined or defined?
</p><p>
Ask pupils to think about different types of people or professions they know existed in ancient Egypt, and list them on the board. Show photographs of objects, wall paintings and images of people from ancient Egypt if possible and ask pupils to classify them based on their actions, clothing and context. See if it is possible to group them together and order them according to who was the most and least privileged. 
</p><p>
Ask them to consider which group would have the largest number of people, and which would have the least.
</p><p>
Compare the class list with the list provided in the background information. How are the two lists similar? How are the two lists different? 
</p><p>
Discuss the types of evidence that might be used to construct a list like this.
</p><p>
Wrap-up the discussion by reinforcing the fact that social structures are usually not so well defined and exact, but that defining a social structure helps us understand some important things about how the civilization worked.

A society is a group of people who live in a community and are dependent upon each other for food, shelter, wealth and land. Societies can be structured in many different ways and some are more flexible than others. Ancient Egyptian social structure was pretty well-defined and rigid. People did not readily move from one level of society to another. This is not to say that it never happened, however, it was not common. There were certain situations where a person from one level of society could move from one to the other, but it usually occurred in the upper levels of society.
</p><p>
This breakdown of the levels of society has been constructed by historians based on objects and texts from ancient Egypt. Thus, the definitions have been made by modern scholars. The ancient Egyptians would not necessarily have seen their social structure in the same way, just as perceptions of modern societies differ whether they are internal or external.
</p><p>
Society in ancient Egypt was made up of many different levels. At each level there were people with similar jobs and economic positions. Where people lived, what they ate, what they wore and what they owned depended on what social class they were a part of.	
</p><p>
This is a general breakdown of the different levels of society:<br>
The highest level of society was the royal family. The royal family included the pharaoh, his wives and his children. They lived in palaces, ate the finest food, and wore the finest clothing and jewellery.  This was the most privileged sector of the population, and represented a tiny percentage of ancient Egyptian society.

</p><p>
Those at the next level of society were the noblemen who surrounded the pharaoh.  They lived well in large homes with plenty of food to eat. They also controlled large estates. These people represented a small  percent of the population.
</p><p>
 The next level of society was made up of scribes. Scribes became officials in the government or temple priests. Successful scribes were promoted to being high officials in the pharaoh's court or high priests. Scribes represented a small percentage of the population.
</p><p>
The next level of society was made up of craftsmen and artisans.  Craftsmen and artisans were often well-to-do by ancient Egyptian standards.  The children of craftsmen or artisans could even attend school to become a scribe if their parents were well-connected.  Craftsmen and artisans made up a relatively small percent of the population. 
</p><p>
The next level of society was made up of  household servants who worked in the homes of wealthy noblemen. They represented a small percent of the population.
</p><p>
The next level of society was made up of farmers.  Farmers usually worked on land that belonged to the pharaoh or the temple.  They had to give a percentage of their harvest as a tax either to the pharaoh or the temple.  They lived in small homes, and traded their crops for other kinds of food.  Farmers made up the bulk of the population.
</p><p>
The lowest level of society was made up of slaves and  foreign captives.  They were usually forced to work on building projects or in the mines for the government or the pharaoh.  They made up a relatively small percentage of the population.
