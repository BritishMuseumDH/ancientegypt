}{\plain \b\fs28 Discussion:}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Begin a discussion by asking pupils to identify some of }{\plain \fs28 the basic necessities of 
life (i.e.: what they require from their environment on a fundamental level to 
ensure survival), such as food, water and shelter. Then discuss how the natural 
resources and landscape of a place can affect whether or not people settle there. 
}{\plain \i\fs28 Can people grow food there? Is there an adequate and sustainable water 
source?}{\plain \fs28  \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Show pupils a map of ancient Egypt and ask them to describe the land.}{\plain \i\fs28  Is there 
a source of water? How much fertile land is there? How is it distributed? }{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Ask pupils to comment on how the nature of this landscape might affect the 
way that people settle and ultimately use the land. }{\plain \i\fs28 Where would they settle, and 
why?}{\plain \fs28  \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Explain some of the ways that the landscape and climate in ancient Egypt was 
unique, and how people used the land. You could make a link with modern 
Egypt by discussing major recent changes made by humans to the environment 
(Suez Canal and Aswan High Dam), and how they have affected the way 
people use the land in Egypt today.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Wrap-up the discussion by emphasising the impact of the land on the way the 
ancient Egyptians lived. It is also important to point out the role the climate has 
played in preserving materials and objects from ancient Egypt.\par
}{\plain \fs28 }{\plain \b\fs28 Background information:}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The geography and climate of ancient Egypt are unique. Egypt is situated in the 
northeast corner of the African continent, bordering on the Mediterranean Sea. 
Most of the land of ancient Egypt was barren desert. However, a narrow strip of 
fertile land on the banks of the Nile river made it possible for life to be 
sustained on the land there. This is why the Greek writer Herodotus called 
Egypt the \'91gift of the river\'92.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The yearly flooding and receding of the Nile determined how people lived in 
ancient Egypt. The land on the banks of the river was devoted to fields where 
crops were grown. During the flood season, this land was under water. When 
the flood waters receded, a layer of rich, mineral enriched black silt was left on 
these fields, leaving them ready to support another crop. This is why the 
ancient Egyptians did not need to add fertilizer to their land, as they do today. \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The bulk of the population lived on the edge of the fertile land and the desert 
for two reasons. The first reason was so their homes would not be left under 
water during the flood.  People lived in homes made from mudbricks (a mixture 
of mud and reeds that was moulded into bricks and left to harden in the sun). 
Since it hardly ever rained in ancient Egypt, the danger of disintegration of the 
mudbrick during a rainstorm was minimal.}{\plain \fs28  However, if a house of mudbricks 
was covered with water for weeks it would not survive. The second reason for 
living on the edge of the desert was so the maximum amount of fertile land 
could be used for planting crops.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \tab \par
}{\plain \fs28 Since the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960's, the interaction 
between people and the land in Egypt has changed dramatically. The Dam has 
ceased the yearly flooding of the Nile river downstream of Aswan. This has 
meant that the fields are no longer replenished by the silt from the flood. 
Farmers now need to use fertilizers to enrich the soil so it can be used for 
growing. \par
