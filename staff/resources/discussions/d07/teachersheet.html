<p>
Introduce your discussion by showing pupils photographs of temples from Egypt and explain that these structures are some of the only buildings that have survived from ancient Egypt. Ask pupils what clues we have about why they were built and how they were used. 
</p><p>
Make a list of questions that they have about temples.
</p><p>
Explain that temples were places of worship in ancient Egypt. Ask pupils to think about what kind of buildings they know of which are dedicated to worship. How are buildings of worship used? 
</p><p>
Point out that in many places of worship there are areas which have restricted access. Explain that most ordinary ancient Egyptians were not allowed into  temples, except on festival days when they were allowed into the courtyard. Ask pupils to think about how the restrictions placed on ordinary people in terms of entering the temple affected their beliefs and the ways that they expressed their beliefs. Explain that most ordinary ancient Egyptians worshipped a different set of gods and goddesses in their homes than were worshipped in the temples.
</p><p>
Point out that ancient Egyptian temples were very large, and occupied a prominent place in the town. Ask pupils to imagine what it might have felt like to see the outside of the temple and know there were important things happening inside. Explain that there was also a practical side to temple life. 
</p><p>
Wrap up the discussion by asking pupils to consider what we can learn about ancient Egypt from looking at temples.

<p>
Ancient Egyptian temples were buildings dedicated to the worship of particular gods and goddesses. The ancient Egyptians believed that temples were in fact the houses of the gods and goddesses. The temple was a place that was set aside for only the most important priests and the pharaoh to go and perform rituals in honour of the god and/or goddess to whom the temple was dedicated.  
</p><p>
Not everyone was allowed to enter the temples on a regular basis. Ordinary people were only allowed into the first area in the temple, called the courtyard, on special festival days. Apart from that, they were never allowed to enter the temple.  
</p><p>
Most ordinary ancient Egyptians worshipped ‘household' gods and goddesses - deities who protected against the dangers of daily life such as snake bites, pregnancy, and childbirth. Deities who were part of the ‘state' religion were seen as much less approachable. The restrictive nature of the temple reinforced the mystery and secretive nature of the gods and goddesses.
</p><p>
The temple was also a centre of commerce and employment. Craftsmen were employed by the temples to make ritual objects to be used in the temple, and objects connected with the temple.  Farmers were required to pay a ‘tax' to the temple, that comprised a percentage of their crops and livestock.  These goods were used to pay the large number of priests who looked after the temple and its grounds.
</p><p>
Thus, the temple was at the centre of life in an ancient Egyptian town. This meant that temples had a fair amount of influence both politically and socially. Many documents survive that attest to a power struggle between the government and the temples.
