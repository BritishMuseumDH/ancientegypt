}{\plain \b\fs28 Discussion:}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Begin the discussion by showing pupils a photograph of different types of 
pyramids. }{\plain \i\fs28 What is a pyramid?}{\plain \fs28  }{\plain \i\fs28 Describe what you see.}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Ask pupils what they know about pyramids. Explain why the pyramids were 
built, what was used to make them, where they were built and when they were 
built.}{\plain \fs28  }{\plain \i\fs28 Who can tell me something about ancient Egyptian pyramids?}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Point out that there are many different pyramids in Egypt, but the pyramids of 
Giza are the most well-known.}{\plain \fs28  They should not assume that the Giza pyramids 
are typical of pyramid building, rather that Giza pyramids were the culmination 
of a long tradition of pyramid building. \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Explain that much information was not known to modern historians about 
ancient Egypt until ancient Egyptian writing was deciphered. Ask them to 
imagine what it might be like to see the Giza pyramids not knowing anything 
about them or the ancient Egyptians. \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Brainstorm a list of questions about ancient Egyptian pyramids and write it on a 
large sheet of paper. Post it in the classroom so pupils can refer back to it as 
they learn more about ancient Egypt and the pyramids.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Wrap-up the discussion by reading an account written by an early explorer such 
as Belzoni about entering the pyramids.}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \b\fs28 Background Information:}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The name \'91pyramid\'92 comes from the Greek word \'91pyramis\'92. The Greeks 
thought that the pyramids looked like a variety of cake that was a similar shape, 
so they used the word  for wheat cake (\'91pyramis\'92) to describe them.}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 Pyramids were tombs built for pharaohs in ancient Egypt. They were built on 
the west bank of the Nile because that was the land of the dead where the sun 
\'91died\'92 each night. \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 It is not clear exactly when or why pyramid building began in ancient Egypt. 
The earliest pyramids were probably built out of mudbrick or mudbrick and 
stone. Many later pyramids, beginning with the Step Pyramid of Djoser at 
Saqqara, were built entirely out of stone. Pyramid building continued for many 
centuries, but seems to have ceased around 1800 B.C.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 There are many different theories about the origin of the pyramid shape. People 
believe that the pyramid shape symbolised the rays of the sun, the primaeval 
mound, or a staircase (or ramp) which the pharaoh could use to ascend to the 
sky after he died. \par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The pyramid shape evolved over many hundreds of years. }{\plain \fs28 The Giza pyramids, 
built between 2600 B.C. and 2500 B.C., are considered to be the high point of 
pyramid building and represent the ideal pyramid shape.\par
}{\plain \fs28 \par
}{\plain \fs28 The pyramids of ancient Egypt have long been a source of curiosity for 
travellers, explorers and historians. In the past few centuries, little was known 
about the pyramids because the writing of the ancient Egyptians had not yet 
been deciphered.}{\plain \fs28  People wondered if the pyramids were solid or if they had 
chambers inside, and if they did have chambers inside, were they empty or full 
of treasure.\par
