<p>
Begin the discussion by showing pupils a photograph of different types of pyramids. What is a pyramid? Describe what you see.
</p><p>
Ask pupils what they know about pyramids. Explain why the pyramids were built, what was used to make them, where they were built and when they were built. Who can tell me something about ancient Egyptian pyramids?
</p><p>
Point out that there are many different pyramids in Egypt, but the pyramids of Giza are the most well-known. They should not assume that the Giza pyramids are typical of pyramid building, rather that Giza pyramids were the culmination of a long tradition of pyramid building. 
</p><p>
Explain that much information was not known to modern historians about ancient Egypt until ancient Egyptian writing was deciphered. Ask them to imagine what it might be like to see the Giza pyramids not knowing anything about them or the ancient Egyptians. 
</p><p>
Brainstorm a list of questions about ancient Egyptian pyramids and write it on a large sheet of paper. Post it in the classroom so pupils can refer back to it as they learn more about ancient Egypt and the pyramids.
</p><p>
Wrap-up the discussion by reading an account written by an early explorer such as Belzoni about entering the pyramids.

<p>
The name ‘pyramid' comes from the Greek word ‘pyramis'. The Greeks thought that the pyramids looked like a variety of cake that was a similar shape, so they used the word  for wheat cake (‘pyramis') to describe them.
</p><p>
Pyramids were tombs built for pharaohs in ancient Egypt. They were built on the west bank of the Nile because that was the land of the dead where the sun ‘died' each night. 
</p><p>
It is not clear exactly when or why pyramid building began in ancient Egypt. The earliest pyramids were probably built out of mudbrick or mudbrick and stone. Many later pyramids, beginning with the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara, were built entirely out of stone. Pyramid building continued for many centuries, but seems to have ceased around 1800 B.C.
</p><p>
There are many different theories about the origin of the pyramid shape. People believe that the pyramid shape symbolised the rays of the sun, the primaeval mound, or a staircase (or ramp) which the pharaoh could use to ascend to the sky after he died. 
</p><p>
The pyramid shape evolved over many hundreds of years. The Giza pyramids, built between 2600 B.C. and 2500 B.C., are considered to be the high point of pyramid building and represent the ideal pyramid shape.
</p><p>
The pyramids of ancient Egypt have long been a source of curiosity for travellers, explorers and historians. In the past few centuries, little was known about the pyramids because the writing of the ancient Egyptians had not yet been deciphered. People wondered if the pyramids were solid or if they had chambers inside, and if they did have chambers inside, were they empty or full of treasure.
