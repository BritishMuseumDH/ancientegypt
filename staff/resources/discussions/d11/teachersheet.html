<p>
Discuss the systems that we use to break time into segments (i.e: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, millennia).How do we measure time? Why is it important, useful or helpful to break time into segments?
</p><p>
Ask pupils to consider the divisions they have identified and define how they are similar and different. Draw a table on the board and ask pupils to classify the ways that we divide time today as either ‘natural' divisions of time or ‘constructed' divisions of time (or by some other system that they define collectively or individually). Which are ‘natural' divisions' and which are ‘constructed' divisions?
</p><p>
Ask pupils to consider the need for these types of systems. Ask them to consider the ways that we use these systems. Why do people create systems and mechanisms for measuring, organising and ordering time?
</p><p>
Discuss the systems and mechanisms that we use today to keep track of time (e.g.: calendars,  watches). What vehicles or mechanisms do we use to keep track of time?
</p><p>
Discuss situations in which we rely on the accuracy of time. Discuss how the need for accuracy in measuring time has brought about the development of such systems and mechanisms. Why do we need this degree of accuracy today?
</p><p>
Establish that there is a relationship between the need to measure time and the creation of ‘constructed' divisions of time. Wrap up the discussion by thinking about what the needs of the ancient Egyptians might have been in terms of measuring time.

<p>
One of the reasons why we create systems of organising and ordering periods of time is that we believe it is important to keep track of dates, events and history. 
</p><p>
The way that time is defined can be broken into two categories: natural divisions and ‘constructed' divisions. Natural divisions of time are those ‘created' by nature, like days and seasons. Constructed divisions of time are those created by humans like seconds, minutes and hours. 		
</p><p>
In general, people across cultures and time have kept track of time to one degree or another depending on their need for accuracy. For example, a farmer in ancient Egypt may have looked at the sun as it went across the sky during the day to determine the relative time (i.e.: was it closer to sunrise or sunset?). The farmer would not necessarily need to know the exact time during the day in order to perform whatever duties he needed to. However, priests in ancient Egyptian temples performed rituals at particular intervals during the day. Thus, they needed to have a method of determining more precisely how much time had passed from one time to the next.
