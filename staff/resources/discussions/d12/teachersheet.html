<p>
Introduce the discussion by defining trades with the class. What is a trade? 
</p><p>
Discuss the people who are involved in trades. Ask pupils to think about the training that they need, the materials that they work with, the tools they use and the quality of the work that they produce. 
</p><p>
Show pupils the photographs of objects from ancient Egypt. Discuss what trades were common in ancient Egypt. What trades do you think they had in ancient Egypt? What type of craftsman do you think would have made this?
</p><p>
Explain what the role of a craftsman in ancient Egypt was, and for whom they were making objects.
</p><p>
Discuss how we know about trades in ancient Egypt- from studying objects, scenes from tomb paintings, and many actual tools which have survived. Discuss the kind of information which can be learned from studying this evidence. What can we learn about ancient Egyptian trades from looking at their tools and the objects that they made?
</p><p>
Wrap-up the discussion by explaining that all goods in ancient Egypt were not made by craftsmen; that most people owned furniture and objects that were more humble than those made by craftsmen. Also point out that people often learn about ancient Egyptians by studying the objects they owned. Learning about trades and craftsmen allows us to think about who made an object as well as who owned it.

<p>
A trade is a profession where the people involved are craftsmen who have been trained in the production of speciality goods. 
</p><p>
There were many different types of craftsmen in ancient Egypt, including jewellers, potters, sculptors, artists, metalworkers, furniture/cabinet makers and weavers. Most craftsmen worked in workshops with other craftsmen creating finely crafted objects for the pharaoh and wealthy people.
</p><p>
Craftsmen were highly trained, often through apprenticeship, and were highly respected. They were considered of a higher class than farmers and labourers. However, they were not considered to be as important as scribes. The distinction between a labourer and a craftsman may not be as great today as it was in ancient Egypt.  
</p><p>
It is important to point out that not all objects from ancient Egypt were made by craftsmen. Pottery, cloth and other necessities of daily life were often made by women who would make clay pots and cloth on a small scale for their families.  Decoration and quality of craftsmanship were less important as these were items whose purpose was primarily utilitarian.
