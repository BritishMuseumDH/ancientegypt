<p>
Discuss why writing is important, emphasizing that writing is a way to communicate information over distance and time, and that writing is a way to record information about business, beliefs and ideas. Why is writing important? How is writing used?
</p><p>
Ask pupils how they use writing in their daily lives, and to imagine what life would be like if they did not write things down. How could you communicate information if you did not have a writing system? 
</p><p>
Discuss different types of information recording systems. Ask pupils to consider how information could be communicated if you did not use a writing system. Explain that one of the first systems used by the ancient Egyptians was a picture- based system. Discuss what the benefits and/or difficulties of a system like that might be. Compare and contrast a picture-based and a writing system. What kind of information could you convey using a picture-based system? What kind of information would it be difficult to convey using a picture-based system?
</p><p>
Introduce and define the word script. Explain how a script is different from a language. Give an example of how the same script can be used to record different languages, such as how the Roman script is used to record English, French, Spanish, etc.. Ask pupils to think of other scripts used around the world. Discuss how scripts are different. What is a script? What is the difference between a script and a language? What other kinds of scripts can you think of that are used around the world today?
</p><p>
Explain that the ancient Egyptians actually used different scripts to record different types of information. For example, hieroglyphic script was used throughout ancient Egyptian history to record information about the pharaoh and religion, whereas, at different times, the hieratic and demotic scripts were used for record-keeping, every day transactions, and literary works. Why might it be important, necessary or meaningful to use different scripts for recording different types of information? 
</p><p>
Ask pupils to consider other ways that information can be conveyed and ‘recorded' such as through stories passed down through generations. How are the details of your own life preserved? How does writing something down change the accuracy and longevity of the information you want to preserve?  What are the benefits and problems with communicating and keeping track of important information through an oral tradition?
</p><p>
Wrap up the discussion by showing photographs of writing from temple walls, statues, and papyri from ancient Egypt.
</p>

<p>
The ancient Egyptians believed that recording information in writing was very important. Writing can be found in temples, on stelai, papyrus, limestone flakes and broken pieces of pottery from ancient Egypt. Consequently, much of what we know about ancient Egypt comes from reading the words the ancient Egyptian scribes wrote down thousands of years ago.
</p><p>
Although hieroglyphic script is one of the oldest writing systems in the world, the ancient Egyptians were recording and communicating information even before hieroglyphs were developed. Before the ancient Egyptians used scripts, they used pictures to communicate and record information. Although it was possible to record some information using a picture-based system, they were not able to record specific information such as the name of a leader, a god, or the events of a battle. 
</p><p>
The ancient Egyptians believed that hieroglyphic writing was a gift from Thoth, the god of writing and knowledge. Historians today believe that the ancient Egyptians developed  hieroglyphic script and other scripts in response to the need for an accurate and reliable way to record and communicate information connected with religion, government and record-keeping.
</p><p>
Different types of information were recorded using different scripts.  The four main scripts used in ancient Egypt at different times were hieroglyphic, hieratic, demotic and coptic. For specific information about these scripts, see the Story in the Writing chapter as well as the Writing Time Line in the Time Explore section.
