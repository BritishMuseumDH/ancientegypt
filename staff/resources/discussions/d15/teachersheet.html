<p>
Begin the discussion by asking pupils to think about why gods and goddesses are important. Ask pupils if they have heard of any gods and goddesses from ancient Egypt. Why are gods and goddesses important?  Who were the gods and goddesses of ancient Egypt? 
</p><p>
Explain that the ancient Egyptians had many different gods and goddesses, each with a different purpose. Give examples of gods and goddesses who represented different aspects of life, geography and natural phenomena.
</p><p>
Show photographs of wall reliefs showing gods and goddesses and ask pupils to comment on the appearance of the gods and goddesses.  Describe what you see. Describe what the gods and goddesses in this picture look like (what are they wearing, what are they doing, how can you- or can you-tell they are a god or goddess?).
</p><p>
Point out (if a pupil does not first) that some gods and goddesses have the heads, bodies, or both of animals. Explain that the ancient Egyptians did not worship animals. Ask pupils to think about why the ancient Egyptians might have shown their gods and goddesses with the heads (or other features) of animals. 	
</p><p>
Wrap-up the discussion by reading an ancient Egyptian creation myth or the myth of Isis and Osiris.

<p>
The ancient Egyptians believed in many gods and goddesses who watched over different aspects of life in ancient Egypt. For example, there were gods who took part in creation, some who brought the flood every year, and some who took care of people after they died.
</p><p>
Some gods and goddesses in ancient Egypt were identified with particular animals. There was often a connection between the god or goddess and the actions of the animal.  For instance, the goddess of war named Sekhmet was sometimes shown with the head of a lion to demonstrate that she was ferocious.
</p><p>
There were two main types of religion and worship in ancient Egypt. They can generally be termed ‘formal' and ‘informal'. In order to understand the importance of gods and goddesses in ancient Egypt it is important to distinguish between formal and informal worship. 
</p><p>
Certain gods and goddesses were part of the ‘formal' or ‘state' religion.  These deities had temples built to honour them. Most people were not allowed into the temples, thus, they were not involved in the day-to-day worship of these deities. The worship of these deities fell to the temple priests and the pharaoh who performed rituals in the temples.
</p><p>
The ‘informal' or ‘popular' religion was centred upon deities who offered protection against the dangers of everyday life, such as snake bites, pregnancy and childbirth. People regularly worshipped these deities in their homes.
