Show pupils a modern object that they are not familiar with. Ask them to describe what they see. Encourage them to keep their comments restricted to what they actually see rather than what they think the object is. Make a list of their observations on the board or a large sheet of paper. What do you see? Describe what you see.
</p><p>
Now ask them to make statements about the object based upon the evidence from their observations. Ask them to support their guesses with evidence. Record all of their guesses on a chalk board or large sheet of paper. 
</p><p>
Ask them to consider another piece of information about the object, such as what material it is made of, or how big it is (if it is a photograph). How might it change your ideas about this object if I told you that it was made of gold?
</p><p>
Divide the class into small groups and give each group an object. Ask them to go through the same process with the new object, then ask them to share their results with the rest of the class. You could also set up stations around the room with objects, and have the groups rotate so they saw several objects.
</p><p>
Wrap-up the discussion by encouraging children to consider how the observation and interpretation of objects might affect how we think about and understand ancient civilizations.
