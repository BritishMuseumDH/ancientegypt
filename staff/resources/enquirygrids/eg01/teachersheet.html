<p>
Have pupils spend a few minutes looking at the wall relief in Pharaoh Explore or Egyptian Life Explore and choose one person to concentrate on. Then, have them gather information about what that person is wearing from the site. The attached sheet can be used, or pupils can make a gathering sheet of their own. Explain the sheet to the children, telling them that they are going to use this sheet to gather information about what people wore in ancient Egypt. Ask pupils to identify the person they are focusing on by their gender, profession, status, or name (a man, woman, dancer, pharaoh, Nebamun). Then ask pupils to look closely at what the person is wearing. Use the ‘What are they wearing?' box to describe articles of clothing and jewellery using words and/or pictures.  Use the ‘What is it made of?' box to record what material it is made of (if they do not definitely know, ask them to make a reasonable guess).
</p><p>
 When they have finished collecting information, ask pupils to write a paragraph or make a poster, showing the person they chose, using the information they gathered about what the person wore. Ask pupils to compare the different people profiled by the class and discuss similarities and differences in what they wore in terms of types of clothing or jewellery, and the materials used to make them.

<p>
Make a chart or graph showing all of the data that the class has collected about what people in ancient Egypt wore. Discuss why they might have been wearing one type of clothing or another. Emphasise the relationships among materials, climate, types of clothing, and social status.

<p>
Ask pupils to collect information about what people wear today using the same information gathering sheet. Compare and contrast what people wear today with what the ancient Egyptians wore. Ask pupils to make specific comparisons such as: Many people wear fake jewellery made of plastic or metal that looks like more precious or costly materials, just as some ancient Egyptians wore jewellery made of glazed composition that looked like turquoise. Or, people wear clothing to suit the climate they live in.

In this enquiry, pupils will learn about what different types of clothing and adornment people wore in ancient Egypt. 


<ul>
<li>
<b>Clothing:</b> Linen was the most common fabric in ancient Egypt because it was readily available and lightweight. Most ancient Egyptians wore skirts or dresses made of linen. The quality of the linen and the elaborateness of the garment depended on the person's social and economic status. Wool was occasionally used for making clothing, but it had to be imported, and it was not practical in the hot Egyptian climate. Cotton was not introduced into Egypt until the Roman Period (30 B.C. to   A.D. 395). 
<li>
<b>Jewellery:</b>  Jewellery was commonly worn in ancient Egypt. Ordinary people had jewellery made of glazed composition, as it was inexpensive and readily available. Wealthier people had jewellery made from gold, glass, glazed composition and semi-precious stones. Gold was the most common metal used in jewellery, as there were many gold mines in Egypt and Nubia. Silver and lapis lazuli were imported to Egypt from the Near East. 
<li>
<b>Hairstyles:</b>  The ancient Egyptians are shown with many different hairstyles. Priests always had shaved heads to show that they were ritually clean. Children often wore a ‘sidelock' (a ponytail pulled to one side of the head). Adults often wore wigs for special occasions.   In introducing this enquiry, be sure to discuss social and economic status as well as climate in ancient Egypt in terms of how they would also affect what people wore.  
<li>
<b>Makeup:</b> In ancient Egypt, both men and women wore makeup. They decorated their eyes with a black paint which we call ‘kohl'. Kohl was kept in small narrow containers and applied with a glass rod. Green eye paint, made from ground malachite was also very popular.
