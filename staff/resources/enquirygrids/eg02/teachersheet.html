<p>
Ask pupils to find the answers to the questions posed on the sheet, or show the relief to the class and brainstorm a list of questions that they will answer using the site. Have them present what they learn about the pharaoh in the form of a paragraph or poster/diagram.

<p>
Have pupils look at the Beit el-Wali relief (or show them the line drawing of it) and ask them to brainstorm a list of questions about the pharaoh and the objects around him. Assign pupils (individually or in groups) different objects relating to the pharaoh. Using the site, and relevant books, ask them to learn about their object (shape, decoration, purpose/importance) and present their findings to the class. Make a mural from the Beit el-Wali line drawings and have pupils label their objects as they appear in the relief.

<p>
Ask pupils to formulate questions about the other representation of the pharaoh in the wall relief using a similar information gathering sheet. Finally, ask them to compare and contrast the two images of the pharaoh and discuss why they both appear on the Beit el-Wali wall relief.
</p>
<p><p>
Ask pupils to choose one object shown with the pharaoh that they think is particularly interesting. Using the information provided by the site, as well as books about ancient Egypt, have them learn more about it and present what they have learned. Suggested topics include: headdresses, sceptres, clothing.

<p>
The pharaoh was the most important person in ancient Egypt. The ancient Egyptians believed he was not only the ruler of the land, but a living god. The pharaoh is shown many different ways in wall reliefs, depending on the type of scene that is being shown. The pharaoh Ramesses II appears twice in the Beit el-Wali scene. This activity is based upon the seated figure of Ramesses II on the right side of the relief. 
</p>
<p>
The purpose of wall reliefs in temples was for the pharaoh to demonstrate to the gods and goddesses that he was doing a good job of maintaining harmony and balance (Ma'at) in the land of Egypt. That is why, in this scene, he is shown conquering enemies and receiving tribute from them. Pharaohs are usually shown with an array of objects and symbols that demonstrate his power and kingship. In this case, the seated Ramesses II is shown sitting on a throne, holding a sceptre, wearing a crown. Ramesses II is also shown on the left side of the relief in battle. He is shown dressed in battle regalia, holding a bow and arrow in his hand and riding in a chariot. These images of the king demonstrate different aspects of kingship in ancient Egypt.
