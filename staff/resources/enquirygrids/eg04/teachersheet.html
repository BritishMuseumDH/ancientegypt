<p>
Ask pupils to collect information using the following sheet about animals in ancient Egypt, or ask them to brainstorm a list of questions about animals in ancient Egypt. Ask them to collect information using the web site, then write a short illustrated guide to the ancient Egyptian animals they found.

<p>
Print out a copy of the line drawing of the Beit el-Wali relief and attach the sheets together. Instruct each pupil choose one (or more, depending on demand) animal. Brainstorm a list of questions, creating a class ‘guide' for collecting information about the animals. Instruct pupils to collect information about their animals using the site, then ask them each to write a paragraph about their animal on an index card. Hang the ‘relief' on the wall. Connect the animals in the relief to the index cards with string.

<p>
Ask pupils to find out what other animals existed in ancient Egypt during the time of the pharaohs. Have them learn about what they looked like, where they were from, and why they were important. Suggestions: hippopotami, crocodiles, jackals, cats, and birds (falcons, ibises). Pupils could also learn about the gods and goddesses associated with these animals.

<p>
Many different types of animals lived in ancient Egypt. Some were indigenous to the Nile valley, and some were brought to Egypt from lands further south in Africa. These animals were brought into Egypt either as trade goods, tribute, or gifts from foreign leaders. 
</p>
<p>
Many animals had religious significance, or were associated with power. Thus, when animals appear in ancient Egyptian wall reliefs, they are often symbolic of something as well as being representative of a particular type of animal.
