Introduce the activity by reading from a traveller or explorer's account of entering the pyramids. Ask pupils to imagine that they are an explorer entering the Great Pyramid for the first time. Explain that as they walk through the Great Pyramid, they will need to take notes about the route they take. They may use the information gathering sheet for this. After they have explored the whole pyramid (inside and outside), ask them to write a diary entry outlining where they went on their adventure.

The ‘Great Pyramid' was built for the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops) in about 2650 B.C.. Situated on the Giza plateau, it was the first of three large pyramids (and several small ‘queens' pyramids) to be built at Giza. The Great Pyramid was part of a pyramid complex which included three queens' pyramids, a satellite pyramid, a mortuary temple and a valley temple. It was originally covered in a layer of white limestone blocks cut from a nearby quarry across the river at Tura. These blocks were stripped off and used to build the city of Cairo.

There are three main chambers inside the Great Pyramid, which are connected by many corridors and passageways. There have been very few objects found inside the Great Pyramid, and understandably so. The Great Pyramid was probably robbed very soon after Khufu was buried there.

In the 19th century, interest in ancient Egypt prompted many westerners to voyage to Egypt. One of the most popular sites was the pyramids of Giza. These explorers often believed that the pyramids held the undisturbed treasure of the pharaohs. At this time, people did not know why the pyramids had been built, and many far-fetched theories circulated as they do today about the original purpose of the pyramids.
