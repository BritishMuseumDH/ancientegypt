<p>
Introduce the activity and ask the pupils to imagine they are young archaeologists who have just discovered some wall paintings from the tomb of Nebamun. Ask them to see what they can work out about Nebamun's life from looking at the wall paintings from his tomb. When they have finished collecting evidence about Nebamun using the enquiry grid, ask them to write a short biography answering the question, ‘Who was Nebamun?'.

</p>
<p>
Brainstorm a list of categories relating to daily life, such as clothing, appearance, pastimes, occupation and family. Split the class into groups and have each group investigate one aspect of Nebamun's life. When they have finished collecting information, have them present their findings to the class, or make a class book about Nebamun.

Choose an object or scene (it could be a topic, such as hunting, or food) from Nebamun's wall paintings. Using the web site and books, ask pupils to learn more about it, presenting their findings in a report or poster.

Nebamun was a nobleman who lived in about 1400 B.C.. In the beginning of the 19th century, his tomb was discovered in the cliffs of western Thebes. The whereabouts of his tomb has since been lost. The five wall paintings in the Egyptian Life Explore section are from Nebamun's tomb.

The ancient Egyptians believed that it was important to prepare for the next life. One way that wealthy people did this was by having elaborately decorated tombs built for themselves. The walls were decorated with scenes of hunting, banquets, gardens and bountiful fields. The function of these scenes was not so much actually to record moments from the person's life, but to ensure that he or she would enjoy plenty in the next life.

<p>
These wall paintings are helpful and informative as they show us a lot about the life of a nobleman in New Kingdom Egypt. However, it is important to remember that they are stylised scenes, meant to represent an idyllic life, rather than a strictly accurate picture of life at that time. That is why there are sometimes incongruities such as why Nebamun's wife, dressed in her finest clothing, should accompany him while he is hunting. It is important to make children aware of the historical context of these paintings, especially since they are removed from their original context, and since paintings in today's world often serve a different purpose.
