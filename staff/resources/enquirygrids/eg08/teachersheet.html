<p>
Explain who a scribe was in ancient Egypt. Ask pupils to imagine they have been sent to scribal school to learn how to read and write. Soon it will be time to work out what job they will take. Have the children collect information from the Writing Explore section, using the enquiry grid. When they have finished, ask them to choose what job they would like to do and write a letter to a friend explaining what the job is and why it is important.
</p>

<p>
Explain who a scribe was in ancient Egypt. Have the children collect information about different jobs a scribe could do from the Writing Explore section, using the enquiry grid. Then divide the class into groups and assign one job to each group. Ask each group to make a case for why that job would be the best position for a young scribe to take. Ask them to present their positions in the form of a brochure, news broadcast or comic strip.

<p>
Ask pupils to choose one of the professions that a scribe could have entered. Using books about ancient Egypt, have them find out more about that profession, and present what they have learnt in a poster, a play or a story.
</p><p>
Or, ask pupils to make a chart showing how they and their classmates use writing every day.

<p>
The only people who could read and write in ancient Egypt were called scribes. People usually became scribes only if their father had been a scribe. They attended a scribal school where they learnt how to read and write.
</p>
<p>
When they left scribe school there were many opportunities open to them. As it was necessary to understand texts and correspondence, all priests, government officials and record-keepers were scribes. 
</p>
<p>
Most ancient Egyptian scribes were men. There is some evidence of female doctors who would have had to read medical texts, however, the number of female scribes was probably pretty few.
