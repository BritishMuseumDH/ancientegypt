<p>
Discuss what natural resources are, and ask pupils to give examples of natural resources. Have pupils look at the natural resources map in the Geography Explore section and choose some natural resources based on a category such as semi-precious stones, stones, or metals. Then ask them to play the Challenge in the same chapter, collecting information about the resources they chose as they play the game. Then ask them to find examples of how the resources they chose were used either on the site or in books. Have them present what they learnt in the form of a poster, map or chart with labels.

</p>

<p>
Divide the class into groups and assign a category to each group. Have them look at the natural resources map and find materials that would fit into their category. Then ask them to play the Challenge, collecting information about resources as they play the game. Then ask them to find examples of how the resources in their category were used, from information found either on the site or in books. Have them present what they learnt in the form of a poster, map or chart with labels.

Ask pupils to find out about other resources (e.g.: lapis, silver, wood) that were not native to ancient Egypt. Then, have them collect information about these resources using the site, books and magazines.  Have them present what they have learnt as a map, chart or poster.
</p><p>
Or, ask pupils to imagine they are working for a company that makes a product (it could be jewellery, furniture or clothing). Ask them to identify the natural resources of their own country and neighbouring countries to work out where they would have to get the raw materials to make their product. Then, present what they have learnt in a report to the company in the form of a paper, a chart or a poster.

Although ancient Egypt had many resources, there were some important resources which were either not found in ancient Egypt, or were inadequate to meet the demand. These resources were brought to ancient Egypt through tribute or trade from neighbouring countries.
</p><p>
One of the most important natural resources which the ancient Egyptians lacked was an adequate supply of wood. Small shrubs and palm trees grew in ancient Egypt, but they did not provide long, straight trunks which could be used to span the roof of a large building, or as a flagpole in front of a temple. One of the most popular types of wood for these purposes was cedar wood from Lebanon.
</p><p>
Silver and lapis lazuli were also highly prized by the ancient Egyptians. These materials were imported to Egypt from the Near East, and used to make jewellery or, in the case of silver, small objects.
