<p>
Introduce the activity by defining what are trades and craftsmen. Ask pupils to look through the workshops in Trades Explore to find some craftsmen, then try the Challenge to learn about other craftsmen and the tools they used. After they have recorded their information on the enquiry grid, ask them to present what they learnt in a poster, chart or diagram.
</p>

<p>
Introduce the activity by defining what are trades and craftsmen. Show pupils photographs of objects such as jewellery, furniture and sculpture from ancient Egypt and discuss which type of craftsman may have made it. Make a list of the different craftsmen. Then divide the class into groups and ask each group to concentrate on one type of craftsman. Ask pupils to gather information by looking through Trades Explore and Challenge. Have them supplement what they learnt by looking for information in books, then ask them to present what they learnt to the class.

<p>
Ask pupils to find out about trades in other ancient civilisations. How were they similar to, and/or different from, those of the ancient Egyptians? What tools did they use? How were they trained? What materials did they use? What was their social standing in the community? Ask pupils to create a poster, make a chart or diagram outlining what they have learned.
</p><p>
Or, ask pupils to make a list of some modern trades, as well as the tools and materials involved with those trades. How are the skills and training required for trades today similar or different from those in ancient Egypt?

<p>
There were many different types of craftsmen in ancient Egypt, including jewellers, potters, sculptors, artists, metalworkers, furniture/cabinet makers and weavers. Most craftsmen worked in workshops with other craftsmen creating finely crafted objects for the pharaoh and wealthy people.
</p>
<p>
Craftsmen were highly trained, often through apprenticeship, and were highly respected. They were considered of a higher class than farmers and labourers. However, they were not considered to be as important as scribes.
</p>
<p>
It is important to point out that not all objects from ancient Egypt were made by craftsmen. Pottery, cloth and other necessities of daily life were often made by women who would make clay pots and cloth on a small scale for their families.  Decoration and quality of craftsmanship were less important as these were items whose purpose was primarily utilitarian.
