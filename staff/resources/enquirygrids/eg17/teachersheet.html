<p>
Introduce the activity by discussing temples. Ask pupils to collect information from the site using the enquiry grid. Then have them use the information they collected to write a guidebook entry about visiting this temple. Remind them that they are trying to encourage people to visit the temple. Therefore, they should be sure to explain the different parts of the temple, and describe the atmosphere, layout and decoration whenever possible.
</p>

<p>
Split the class into groups and assign each group one part of the temple to learn about. Ask them to visit the entire temple in the Temples Story, then go to Explore to learn about their particular area of the temple. Have them write a paragraph about their area for a class guidebook. Bring the class together and discuss the unifying elements necessary for a guidebook. Order the book, put the paragraphs and illustrations together with the unifying elements (such as a table of contents or index) and bind the book.

<p>
Ask pupils to choose a real temple in ancient Egypt and write a guidebook entry describing the temple.  Include the name, location, and age of the temple, as well as to which god or goddess it was dedicated. Encourage pupils to include atmospheric descriptions of the spaces whenever possible.
</p><p>
Or, ask pupils to compare an ancient Egyptian temple to a temple (or place of worship) built by another culture from around the world. Include ways in which they are similar and/or different in terms of shape, layout, decoration, function, purpose and access.  Create a poster showing the two temples compared, and label the different areas.

<p>
Ancient Egyptian temples were buildings dedicated to the worship of particular gods and goddesses. The ancient Egyptians believed that temples were in fact the houses of the gods and goddesses. The temple was a place that was set aside for only the most important priests and the pharaoh to go and perform rituals in honour of the god and/or goddess to whom the temple was dedicated.  
</p>
<p>
Not everyone was allowed to enter the temples on a regular basis. Ordinary people were only allowed into the first area in the temple, called the courtyard, on special festival days. Apart from that, they were never allowed to enter the temple.  
</p>
<p>
The focal point of a temple was the sanctuary where the statue of the god or goddess was kept. Each room in the temple leading towards the sanctuary was more holy than the last (for example, the first area, the courtyard, was not as sacred as the hypostyle hall, and the hypostyle hall was not as sacred as the second hall, and so on). The most sacred part of the temple, the sanctuary, was located at the rear of the temple. Only the high priest and the pharaoh were allowed in this area to perform rituals.
