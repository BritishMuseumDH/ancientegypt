Introduce the activity by explaining that a prominent Egyptologist named Dr. E Gypt has just published a book where he claims life was easy for ancient Egyptian farmers. Ask them to decide if they agree or disagree with Dr. E Gypt's statement. Discuss ways that evidence can be used, and to avoid generalising. Then have them collect evidence from the Egyptian Life Story using the enquiry grid. They enter evidence, such as the fact that the nobleman and farmer both ate bread for breakfast in the evidence column. Then, in the next column they explain how the evidence supports their position, such as ‘They both ate bread for breakfast, meaning that they ate some of the same foods'. Ask them to write a letter to Dr. E. Gypt stating their position, supporting their argument with evidence.
</p>

<p>
Organise a debate where pupils debate the validity of Dr. E. Gypt's statement. Divide the class into two groups and tell one half that they will be arguing in support of the statement and the other half that they will be arguing against the statement. Have pupils read the Egyptian Life Story, collecting evidence to support their position, and recording it on the enquiry grid.

Ask pupils to find out more information about how noblemen, farmers and their families lived in ancient Egypt. Encourage them to find out what other evidence there is about their lives and work, and how they fit into society in ancient Egypt. They could present what they learned in the form of a poster, biography or play.

<p>
The class structure was fairly rigid in ancient Egypt. Noblemen enjoyed privileged lifestyles, wearing fine clothes and jewellery and controlling large estates. Farmers, on the other hand did not have an easy life. During the flood season they often went to work on building projects for the pharaoh as their fields were under water. Then, during the planting and harvesting seasons they worked the land. The land they farmed belonged either to noblemen or the temple, to whom they gave a percentage of their harvest each year.
</p>
<p>
Many of the objects that survive from ancient Egypt represent the upper classes, as they could afford items made of more durable materials and exhibited finer craftsmanship. In addition, wealthy people were often buried in tombs decorated with paintings depicting scenes from daily life. Consequently, we know a relatively decent amount of information about how the upper classes in ancient Egypt lived. 
</p>
<p>
Conversely, many objects owned by farmers were made of less durable materials and were less well-crafted. Thus, what we know of the daily lives of farmers is not a complete picture.  It is important to point out these aspects of the archaeological record to children.
