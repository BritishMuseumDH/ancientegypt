<p>
Discuss creation myths with the class. Then, ask them to read through the Story in the Gods and Goddesses chapter. Instruct them to collect as much information as they can about the characters in the story, recording the information they find on the enquiry grid. Ask them to look up the gods and goddesses in the Explore section of Gods and Goddesses to complete the sheet. Have them present what they have learned in a poster, diagram or story.
</p>

<p>
Discuss creation myths with the class and explain personification. Ask pupils to predict which elements of the universe would be represented in a creation myth, such as the sky, the earth or the air. Make sure that the elements are broad enough so that most will be represented in some way in the story. Break the class into groups and ask each group to choose one element, or assign each group an element. Have them read through the Story, collecting information about their element on their enquiry grid. Then, instruct them to supplement the information they collected by using the Explore section. Ask each group to write a myth about some aspect of their element (such as, ‘why the sky can be so many different colours) and present it to the class as a book, comic strip or play.

<p>
Ask pupils to find out about other creation myths from around the world. Have them explore questions such as, ‘what are the similarities and differences with the ancient Egyptian creation myth told on the site?'. Ask them to present what they have learnt in the form of a chart, poster,  book, paragraph, comic strip or play, detailing the stories that were found.
</p>
<p>
Or, ask pupils to write their own creation myth, laying out the creation of the real world or an imaginary world. Discuss what the purpose of a creation myth is, and which elements (components of the universe, natural phenomena) should be explained in their creation myth. Ask them to illustrate their story and present it as a comic strip, book or play.

The ancient Egyptians believed in many different gods and goddesses, each with their own domain, appearance and purpose. In ancient Egyptian beliefs there were often overlaps of beliefs, or differing versions of stories featuring the gods and goddesses. These discrepancies did not bother the ancient Egyptians, they accepted that many versions of stories were acceptable, even if we find them mutually exclusive. 
</p>
<p>
 This is especially clear in the case of their creation myths. For example,the principal deity in Thebes during the New Kingdom was Amun-Ra. One creation myth has him creating the world. At Memphis, the principal deity was Ptah. Another creation myth has Ptah speaking the world into being.
</p>
<p>
There are many different reasons for why the various stories co-existed.  First, because they existed in different parts of the country, there was not necessarily a conflict in terms of beliefs; people just had different beliefs based on where they lived. And because there was a general agreement about the pantheon, that was enough religious unity to bind the country together. Second, the origin of the stories was often so far back that the stories were firmly set in the minds of the priests and an established part of the theology; it would be very difficult to give up a creation story simply for religious unity or a political shift.
</p>
<p>
The creation story presented on the site attributes different aspects of the universe to different deities. It also makes a link between the deities who represent different parts of the universe and those who then rule over what has been created by their ancestors. The story ends with Horus being the ruler of the earth and Osiris being the ruler of the underworld. The ancient Egyptians believed that the pharaoh was a living god. Therefore, he was called the ‘living Horus'.
