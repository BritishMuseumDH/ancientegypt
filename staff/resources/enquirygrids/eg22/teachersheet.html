Introduce the activity by discussing materials with pupils and brainstorming a list of categories of materials such as wood, metal and stone. Then ask them to imagine they are conservators doing a survey of objects to see what types of materials are represented in a collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts. Have them collect information from the site using the enquiry grid to record their evidence. When they are finished, ask them to put the evidence they found into categories. Have them present what they learnt in the form of a chart or poster.

<p>
Introduce the activity by discussing materials with pupils and brainstorming a list of categories of materials such as wood, metal and stone. Split the class into groups, assigning a category to each group. Then ask them to imagine they are conservators doing a survey of objects to see what types of materials are represented in a collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts. Have them collect information from the site using the enquiry grid to record their evidence. Ask each group to learn more about their category of materials from the rest of the site (see Geography Explore for a map of natural resources), or from books, and make a presentation to the class.

Ask pupils to make a class list of all the objects in their classroom that they think might last for a long time.  What might archaeologists find, what might they deduce about the pupils and their lives from those objects, what would they not be able to learn about the pupils, the pupils' lives, habits and culture from those objects.

Some of the materials that do survive in a hot, dry climate like that of Egypt are stone, papyrus, some textiles with a strong weave, glass, metal, some pottery,  and some wood. Objects made from these materials could generally be expected to survive in one state or another. Some of the materials that do not survive well are light textiles, or textiles made from inferior materials, some pottery and some wood.
</p>
<p>
It was mostly wealthy people who could afford to have objects that were made of better materials and were of a higher standard of craftsmanship. In addition, objects made for temples would also be made of the best materials. Finally, the ancient Egyptians believed that objects which were placed in tombs were provisions for the next life. Thus, the objects that have been found in the tombs of wealthy people represent a much higher standard of craftsmanship, decoration and quality than some of the objects found at archaeological sites. 
</p>
<p>
 This means that some of the objects on which we base our assumptions about ancient Egyptian life over- represent certain aspects of life, and a select segment of society. Thus, it is important to also ask the question, ‘what has not survived?' when looking at objects from ancient Egypt.
