<p>
Discuss the purpose of funerary objects with the class. Then, ask pupils to imagine they are archaeologists studying ancient Egyptian burials. Ask them to think about what they can learn about what was important to the ancient Egyptians by examining what they buried people with. Have them collect information about funerary objects from the Mummification Explore section using the enquiry grid. Then, ask them to present what they have learnt in the form of a poster, diagram or book.

<p>
Ask pupils to collect information in the same manner as outlined above. Then, split the class into groups and ask each group to research one particular object they learnt about, such as amulets, coffins or shabtis. Ask them to present what they have learnt to the class in the form of a poster, book, diagram or paper.

<p>
Ask pupils to find out how people from other cultures were or are buried. What items are buried with them? How are their ideas about burial similar to, or different from those of the ancient Egyptians.

<p>
The ancient Egyptians believed in burying their dead with certain objects and provisions so that the person who died would have what they needed to keep them safe and comfortable in the next life. Therefore, objects which were buried with a person were chosen carefully.
</p>
<p>
Some objects like amulets had abstract powers of protection, while others, like canopic jars had a specific practical, as well as spiritual, purpose. It is important to remember that not every person in ancient Egypt was buried with extensive funerary equipment. However, even the most humble graves which have been found show that items of both practical and spiritual purposes were buried with people to be used by them in the next life.
