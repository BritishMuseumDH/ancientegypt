<p>
Ask pupils to read the Story in the Time chapter and fill in the enquiry grid with the appropriate information about how the ancient Egyptians kept track of time. Then, have them fill in the sheet with the corresponding modern ways of keeping time. Or, brainstorm a list of modern ways of keeping track of time and have pupils record information about how the ancient Egyptians kept track of time according to those divisions.

</p>
<p>
Brainstorm a list of divisions of time. Assign one division of time to each group in the class. Have them collect information about how the ancient Egyptians kept time in terms of the division their group has been assigned, and compare it to modern methods. Ask them to explain why it was important to be able to measure that amount of time in ancient Egypt, and why it is important today (i.e.: the water clock kept track of hours during the night, which was important because there were rituals to be performed during the night). Then, have the class share what they have learned.

<p>
Ask pupils to find out about how other cultures and/or civilizations measured time.  What were their methods? How were they similar to, or different from those used in ancient Egypt (or those used today)? Encourage pupils to consider the relationship between the function (or need) of a system for measuring time, and the system itself (i.e.: systems are created to fulfil a need). Have pupils present their findings in a poster or a time line.

<p>
The ancient Egyptians kept track of time in many different ways. The methods that people used to keep track of time depended upon their needs, often relating to the degree of precision they needed in their time-keeping. For instance, farmers kept track of the hours during the day by watching the sun's movement across the sky. They did not need very precise ways of tracking the hours, whereas temple priests needed a more accurate way of keeping track of time so that rituals were performed on time.
