<p>
Ask pupils to imagine they are caterers who have been asked to prepare a feast to celebrate the opening of a new Egyptian gallery at a museum. They will need to collect information about what the ancient Egyptians did and did not eat so they know what to serve. Ask them to collect information from the Egyptian Life Story and Explore sections of the site, using the enquiry grid to record what they have learnt. This will be important in case anyone asks them how they decided what to serve. Ask them to create a menu, including some of the foods that the ancient Egyptians would have enjoyed, and draw or describe what the food tables will look like for the banquet.
</p>

<p>
Brainstorm a list of types of food or drink that the ancient Egyptians might have had. Then create a list of categories such as fruit, drinks, or meat. Break the class into groups and ask each group to choose a category, or assign them categories. Have them collect information about foods or drinks in their category from the site using the enquiry grid. Ask them to supplement their work by looking in books to learn more about what the ancient Egyptians ate and drank. Then, ask them to present what they have learnt to the class in a poster or through a written explanation.

<p>
Ask pupils to compare and contrast the types of food available to the ancient Egyptians to what is available to people today. Have them learn about where some foods are from, and think about what the impact of refrigeration, railways and aeroplanes has been on what we can find in supermarkets today.

<p>
The basic staples of the ancient Egyptian diet were bread, meat, fruit and beer. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Bread:</b><br>
Bread was made into loaves of many different shapes. It is not clear how these types of bread were different from each other, but they are shown as being different shapes in wall paintings. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Meat and Fish:</b><br>
Wealthier people often ate different types of meat, including fowl. The leg of an ox was considered to be very special. Some types of fish were eaten, but other types were thought to be sacred, so they were not eaten. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Fruit:</b><br>
Many different types of fruit were available to the ancient Egyptians, such as dates, figs and grapes. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Beer and Wine:</b><br>
Wine and beer were popular drinks. Beer was drunk from a straw like the one shown in the Egyptian Life Story, because it was necessary to filter out the impurities left over from the brewing process.
