<p>
Provide children with background information on ancient Egyptian pyramids. Discuss why they were built, how big they are, and what they are made of.
<p>
Explain that no one knows for sure how the pyramids were built, but there are many theories which have been formulated to work out how it might have been done.  
<p>
Discuss what some of the problems in building a pyramid might be in terms of design and construction (i.e.: keeping the sides even so the blocks meet at the top, in which order to place the blocks, how to build it up- from the inside out or from the ground up).
<p>
Explain that they will be building their own pyramids. Remind them that they do not have to deal with difficult issues such as labour and moving enormous blocks long distances. However, they will have to consider some of the same issues as the ancient Egyptians (like slope and the number of blocks used overall).
<p>
Divide the class into small groups (or have children work independently) and ask pupils to develop theories about how the pyramids could have been built. Ask them to record their thoughts as they develop their ideas. 
<p>
Provide them with building materials and allow them to test their theories. Ask them to make a presentation about how they built their pyramid.

The name 'pyramid' actually comes from the Greek word 'pyramis'. The Greeks thought that the pyramids looked like a common type of cake that was a similar shape, so they used the word  for wheat cake ('pyramis') to describe them.
<p>
Pyramids were tombs built for pharaohs in ancient Egypt. They were built on the west bank of the Nile because that was the land of the dead where the sun 'died' each night. 
<p>
It is not clear exactly when or why pyramid building began in ancient Egypt. The earliest pyramids were probably built out of mudbrick or mudbrick and stone. Many later pyramids, beginning with the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara, were built entirely out of stone. Pyramid building continued for many centuries, but seems to have ceased around 1800 B.C.
<p>
There are many different theories about the origin of the pyramid shape. People believe that the pyramid shape symbolised the rays of the sun, the primaeval mound, or a staircase (or ramp) which the pharaoh could use to ascend to the sky after he died. 
<p>
There are also many different theories explaining how the pyramids were built. Most Egyptologists believe that the ancient Egyptians used ramps in one form or another. The Pyramids Story presents what one type of ramp could have been like, however, the ancient Egyptians probably used many different types of ramps. No one really knows for sure.  
<p>
One of the most common misconceptions is that the pyramids were built by slaves. The latest understanding is that the pyramids were built by farmers during the flood season (Innundation), when their fields were under water.  It was demanding, difficult work; however, it was not slavery. The pyramid builders were compensated with food and shelter for the period during which they worked.
