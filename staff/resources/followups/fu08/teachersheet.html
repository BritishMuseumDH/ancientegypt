<p>
Introduce the activity by reminding pupils of what a wall relief is by showing them photographs of temples from ancient Egypt. Then explain how a wall relief was made.
<p>
Explain that proportion was very important to the ancient Egyptians. Ask pupils to imagine how they would transform a small picture into a large one- the size it would need to be to cover a large temple wall.
<p>
Print out the Beit el-Wali line drawing and draw a grid over one page of it. Make a copy of the page for each pupil in the class. Assign one of the squares on the grid to each of the pupils and have them make an A4 sized copy of their square. 
<p>
Decide on a colour scheme for the picture and have pupils colour in their squares. When the class has done this, have them attach their squares together, referring to the original picture.
<p>
Discuss the difference in size between the original drawing and the final drawing. What would be the benefits of using a method like this as opposed to drawing a larger version of the drawing freehand.

<p>
The walls of ancient Egyptian temples were decorated with carved and painted wall reliefs.  These reliefs showed ceremonies and rituals that the ancient Egyptians believed were necessary to maintain order in the world.  They also showed battles and tribute scenes which were an important part of maintaining power and balance in the world as well. 
<p>
The ancient Egyptians had definite ideas and established ways of presenting people and gods, and depicting ritual scenes. The most important or distinctive aspects of the human body are shown in poses that are anatomically impossible to recreate. However, the ancient Egyptians believed that it was important to show the distinguishing elements of the body to represent the person symbolically rather than to attempt to portray them exactly as they appeared in life. The scenes in temples are divided into military and religious depending on the area of the temple where they appeared. Scenes are often shown divided by lines called 'registers'.
<p>
All ancient Egyptian wall reliefs were originally carved and painted.  However, most of the paint has worn off the reliefs that we see in ancient Egyptian temples today.
<p>
  The following are the six basic steps to creating wall reliefs.
<p>
	a.  The temple or tomb wall was smoothed down or plastered.<br>
	b.  A grid was drawn on the wall to guide the artists.<br>
	c.  Using paint, the artists sketched the figures and the scribes wrote the hieroglyphs on the wall.<br>
	d.  Craftsmen carved the rock based on the sketches.<br>
	e.  The carving/painting (especially of the hieroglyphs) was checked and corrected by the artists and the scribes.<br>
	f.  The carved wall was painted.
<p>
For decorating tombs, craftsmen followed the same process as for making wall reliefs, leaving out step d.
