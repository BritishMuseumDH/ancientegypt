<p>
Discuss the purpose of a museum with pupils. Ask them to think about their experiences with museums. What is a museum? How is a museum used? Why are museums important? 
</p><p>
Ask pupils to imagine they are curators working in a museum and tell them that it is their job to create a museum exhibit about ancient Egypt (you could suggest that they play the Pharaoh Challenge to learn about what curators, conservators and archaeologists do). Create a scenario explaining why the museum wants them to put on an exhibition of ancient Egyptian objects. Then introduce them to the ‘collection'. Show them some photographs or pictures of ancient Egyptian objects from magazines or books.
</p><p>
Make a list of themes or topics related to ancient Egypt with the class that they enjoyed learning about. Decide which theme or topic the exhibit will cover, and discuss the theme or topic as a class.
</p><p>
Ask pupils to think about how museums present objects and what support materials are provided in exhibitions such as labels and gallery guides.
</p><p>
Ask pupils to think of some objects that might be important to include in this exhibit on ancient Egypt. Then instruct them to choose a type of object they would like to include in the exhibit. Provide them with magazines, books,  postcards and access to the site so they can choose an object to include in the exhibit. Ask them to cut out a photograph of their object from a magazine or draw a picture of their object from the site or a book. 
</p><p>
Discuss museum labels with the class. What is their purpose? What type of information do they present? What style are they written in? 
</p><p>
Ask pupils to decide what information needs to go on the museum labels, then write a label to go with their object.
</p><p>
Discuss different ways the exhibit might be arranged (chronologically, by materials, themes). Arrange the objects and attach labels to tables or stands. 
</p><p>
Create a exhibition guide using the labels the children have written.
</p><p>
Hold a party to celebrate the opening of the exhibit.
