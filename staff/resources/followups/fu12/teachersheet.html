<p>
Discuss ideas for a class book on ancient Egypt. Ask pupils to work out what elements always appear in books, or what they think is necessary to include such as page numbers, a table of contents, an index, and a glossary. Decide which elements are overall elements and which only concern the contents of individual chapters.
<p>
Brainstorm ideas for chapter subjects and decide how many chapters to include. Draw up a draft table of contents. Assign pupils to groups and decide which group will cover which topic or theme.  
<p>
Establish a publishing sequence for deciding on ideas, collecting information, writing and proofreading work within groups or among individuals. Assign an editor, or act as editor yourself for the entire book. 
<p>
Decide on a format (or not) for the chapters. Which elements need to be standard and which do not? What will you do about illustrations?
<p>
Vote on the design for the cover of the book. Finalise the table of contents, and number the pages. 'Bind' a class book. Or, make enough copies of the book for each member of the class to have their own. Then, bind the books with special paper or have each pupil decorate their own cover.
<p>
Hold a publishing party.
