<p>
The only people who could read and write in ancient Egypt were called scribes. People usually became scribes only if their father had been a scribe. They attended a scribal school where they learnt how to read and write.
<p>
When scribes left scribe school there were many opportunities open to them. As it was necessary to understand texts and correspondence, all priests, government officials and record-keepers were scribes. 
<p>
Most ancient Egyptian scribes were men. There is some evidence of female doctors, who would have had to be able to read medical texts; however, the number of female scribes was probably few.
<p>
Scribes had many different pieces of equipment: a palette which held their reed pens and two cakes of ink, a papyrus scroll for recording information, a briefcase which held their palette, extra papyrus scrolls and ink, and a document box which held old records. 
<p>
Papyrus was one of the most common materials used for writing, but it was expensive.  It was lightweight and flexible, which was important when it was used for record-keeping. Papyrus was also easy to store because the scrolls were not bulky. Although papyrus was a common writing material, it was not wasted; scribes often used both sides of a papyrus scroll for keeping records so that they did not waste the papyrus.
