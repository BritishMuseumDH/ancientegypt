Scribes were the only people in ancient Egypt who knew how to read and write. This was considered a great privilege, and scribes were respected by most people. 
<p>
Scribes had many different tools which they used to do their job. Today you will follow a scribe around and look after his tools for him. Pay attention, for if you leave something behind, the scribe will not be able to do his work.

<p><b>Instructions</b></p>

Today you will be going to a nobleman's estate. Here, the scribe will count the nobleman's geese. Immediately after you arrive, the document box is opened and the scribe looks through the papyrus scrolls inside. Find the document box in this scene. Why is this box important?
</p>

<p>
The scribe finds an old papyrus and unravels it. After he has read it, he puts it back into the document box and asks for his briefcase. What does the scribe keep in his briefcase?
</p>

<hr><br><hr><br><hr><br><hr><br>


<p>
You hold out the briefcase to him and he looks through for his palette. He pulls the palette out of the briefcase and puts it under his arm. Describe what the palette looks like, then sketch it below.

The palette is the most important tool that the scribe uses. He adds water to the ink on the end of the palette and pulls out one of the reed pens. Scribes only needed two colours for record-keeping. Most of the writing was done in black ink, but each sentence began with a letter in red ink. Red ink was also used to make corrections. Other colours of ink or paint were used to decorate the scenes drawn on papyrus.  Look at the end of the palette where there are still traces of paint. How many spaces are there for colours on these palettes?

The scribe takes out a papyrus scroll with writing on one side. He unrolls it, flips it over and holds it up in front of himself. Why was papyrus a good material to write on?
</p>

<hr><br><hr><br><hr><br><hr><br>

<p>
The scribe counts the geese and records the numbers on his papyrus scroll. When he hass finished, the scroll is put into the document box. When it is time for the scribe to report back to the nobleman, he will be able to find the information he needs. 
<p>
It is time for you to pack up all the scribe's tools. Now that you have seen the scribe at work, answer the following question. Which tool or piece of equipment do you think is the most important to the scribe?

<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<p>Why would a scribe's work be important to a nobleman or landowner in ancient Egypt?</p>
