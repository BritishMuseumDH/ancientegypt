<p>
There were many different types of craftsmen in ancient Egypt, including jewellers, potters, sculptors, artists, metalworkers, furniture/cabinet makers and weavers. Most craftsmen worked in workshops with other craftsmen creating finely-crafted objects for the pharaoh and wealthy people.
<p>
Craftsmen were highly trained, often through apprenticeship, and were highly respected. They were considered of a higher class than farmers and labourers. However, they were not considered to be as important as scribes.
<p>
It is important to point out that not all objects from ancient Egypt were made by craftsmen. Pottery, cloth and other necessities of daily life were often made by women who would make clay pots and cloth on a small scale for their families.  Decoration and quality of craftsmanship were less important as these were items whose purpose was primarily utilitarian.
