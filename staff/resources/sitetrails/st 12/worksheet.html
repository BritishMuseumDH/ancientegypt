<b>Making a necklace</b>
</p><p>
Enter the jeweller's workshop. All of the craftsmen you see are working on different parts of the process of making a necklace. The process starts when rough stones are brought to the workshop. They need to be smoothed down before they can be made into beads. Find the man who is smoothing rough beads on a polishing block. What does he use to polish the beads?
</p>

<p>
The beads are now polished and the next stage in the process is to make holes in the beads. Find the men who are making holes in the beads. What tool are they using? Do you think this tool would be easy or difficult to use? Why?
</p>

<p>
Next, the smooth beads are strung onto papyrus string. Can you see the table which is piled high with rolls of papyrus string? 
<p>
Many different types of jewellery were made out of beads. There are two different types shown in this workshop. Describe them below.
