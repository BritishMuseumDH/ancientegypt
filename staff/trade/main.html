<!--- --------------STORY ---------------- --->
The Story is an ancient Egyptian text entitled ‘The teaching of Duaf's son Khety'.  This text, sometimes called the ‘Satire of the Trades', features a father taking his son to school to become a scribe.  As they make their journey, the father outlines the hardships encountered by craftsmen and workers, emphasizing the difficulties that they face in their lives. Although this text can be taken as a condescending look at the lives of the less fortunate, it is most often interpreted as a father exaggerating the difficulties of other walks of life in order to convince his reluctant son to attend school. This section could be used to discuss the social position of craftsmen in relation to scribes, nobles and farmers, or to introduce the social structure of ancient Egypt.

<!--- ------------ EXPLORE ----------------- --->
The explore section presents the workshop of a jeweller and a carpenter.  These clickable scenes include the tools and materials used by the craftsmen in their work.  The finished products such as necklaces, collars, beds and cabinets are also shown.  This section could be used to teach about what life was like in an ancient Egyptian workshop, and how it was different from modern factories.
