<!--- --------------STORY ---------------- --->
‘The Old Master Scribe' is the story of a meeting between an old scribe and a young scribe. The old scribe explains the history of ancient Egyptian writing and the different scripts used throughout ancient Egyptian history. Pupils can find out more information about writing in ancient Egypt by clicking on the images in the story. This section could be used to introduce the idea that the ancient Egyptians used different scripts to record different types of information.

<!--- ---------- CHALLENGE ----------------- --->
‘Making sense' is an activity based on one aspect of hieroglyphic writing, the determinative or sense signs. In hieroglyphic writing, there are certain words which are spelled using the same consonants (the ancient Egyptians did not write with vowels). Scribes would differentiate one word from another by adding a sense sign to the end of the word. Thus, the sense sign would determine the meaning of the word.

Pupils roll over a story written in hieroglyphs to read the story.  At three different points in the story, they must decide which ‘sense sign' to add to a word depending on the context of the sentence in which the word appears.
