<P>
Cats were very important to the ancient Egyptians. Statues like this were made for use in temples and in private homes.
<p>
The cat has gold rings through its ears and nose. It also has two symbols on its chest.  One is the ‘eye of Horus', which was a symbol of protection. The other is the winged scarab beetle, which is a symbol of rebirth.
