<P>
This stone tells a story about the pharaoh Shabaka.  One day Shabaka was visiting a temple in Lower Egypt. During his visit he saw some old papyrus scrolls that had been damaged by insects and rodents. When he learned that a creation story was written on the damaged papyrus scrolls, Shabaka was not happy. 
<p>
Shabaka decided that the creation story should be carved into stone so that it would be preserved forever. Thus, the story of Shabaka and the papyrus scrolls, as well as a creation story, were carved into this stone.	
</p>
<p>
Many years after it was carved, this stone was taken out of the temple and used as a grinding stone for grain.  That is why it is deeply carved in the centre.
