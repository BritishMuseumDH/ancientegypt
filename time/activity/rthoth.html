Baboons were important animals in ancient Egypt.  Every morning when the sun appeared on the horizon, baboons would make noise and move around.  The ancient Egyptians believed that the baboons were celebrating the rising sun.  Since the rising of the sun was very important to the ancient Egyptians, they believed that baboons were special.</p>
<p>
The baboon was also a symbol of the god Thoth. Thoth was the god of writing and knowledge.</p>
