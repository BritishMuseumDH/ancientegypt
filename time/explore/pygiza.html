In the fourth dynasty, three large stone pyramids were built at <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/giza01.html','giza01')">Giza</a>. The design of these pyramids was based on earlier pyramids. These are the largest and sturdiest pyramids ever built in ancient Egypt.

<font face="times" size="-1">Pyramids of Giza</font>
</center>
<p>
The first and largest pyramid was built for the pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops).
<p>
The second largest pyramid was built for Khufu's son, Khafra (also known as Chephren). In addition to the usual parts of a pyramid <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/compl01.html','compl06')">complex</a>, Khafra's pyramid is guarded by a huge <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/sphinx01.html','sphinx02')">sphinx</a>.

<p>										
Finally, the third largest pyramid was built for the pharaoh Menkaure (also known as Mycerinus).
<p>
The ancient Egyptians continued to build pyramids for their pharaohs after the Giza pyramids were built.  However they were never as big or well-designed as the Giza pyramids.
