<p>

Hatshepsut was a pharaoh who ruled ancient Egypt from 1473 B.C. to 1458 B.C.. Hatshepsut 
came to power because her step-son (Thutmosis III) was too young to take the throne.  
<p>
She was supposed to rule for Thutmosis III until he was old enough to rule on his own. However, after several years, Hatshepsut declared herself the pharaoh. Many important people at that time did not agree with her right to rule, but Hatshepsut ruled for many years on her own. When she died, Thutmosis III became the pharaoh. 
<p>
Many of the monuments that were built during Hatshepsut's reign, and many statues of her were destroyed after she died. People destroyed them because they were a reminder of the time when she was the ruler.
