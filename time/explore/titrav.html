<b>Giovanni Belzoni</b>
Giovanni Battista Belzoni explored Egypt in the beginning of the nineteenth century. He was originally trained as an engineer, but was most famous for being a strongman in a circus.  Belzoni travelled to Egypt in 1816, to find work moving large statues. 
<p>
While he was in Egypt, Belzoni became interested in ancient Egypt. He travelled around Egypt, exploring tombs, temples and the pyramids. One of his greatest discoveries was the beautiful tomb of the pharaoh Seti I.
