Mehetra studied the wall in front of her. Each cartouche contained the name of a pharaoh. Did this problem with the calendar really mean that the world was falling into chaos? 
<p>
Then, Mehetra's eye fell upon a clear carving of a 'shen' sign. The shen stood for eternity. It had been carved into the wall to show that Egypt would continue forever. Mehetra knew that the priests would work out the problem so that the heavens and the calendar on the temple wall were in <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/harmon01.html','harmon01')">harmony</a>.

Mehetra turned away from the wall and walked out into the temple courtyard. The sun was shining down brightly. As Mehetra began to do her duties, she wondered if Amenemopet would know what was happening the next time she saw him.
