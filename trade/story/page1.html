This story is part of an ancient Egyptian text known as 'The teaching of Duaf's son Khety'.  A father is taking his son to scribe school where the boy will learn how to read and write.  The father is telling his son why being a scribe is the best <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/profes01.html','profes01')">profession</a> in the world.  He <a href="#" onClick="openWin('../../glossary/emphas01.html','emphas01')">emphasises</a> how good the life of a scribe is by comparing it  to the lives of craftsmen and others. 
<p>
Although the father speaks badly of the other professions, he probably does not mean it as strongly as it sounds. More likely, he is making it seem that life is very bad for other people so that he can convince his son to become a scribe.
